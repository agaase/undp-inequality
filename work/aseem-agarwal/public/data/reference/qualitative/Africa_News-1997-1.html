<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRAIA, Cape Verde (PANA) - In spite of its poverty, Cape Verde says that over two decades it has been able to halve its child mortality rate with the introduction of a Child and Maternal Health care program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of social development in the archipelago's health ministry, Dr Frutuoso Carvalho, says poverty prompted the government to opt for a policy of protecting the society's &quot;most vulnerable groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official statistics show that 30 percent of Cape Verde's 433,000 population are poor, while 14 percent are considered to be very poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the total population, 52 percent live in Praia, the capital, which is located on the main island of Santiago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before 1995, when Cape Verde adopted its national population policy, the government had committed resources to protecting the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This support has taken the form of a maternal and infant protection program which was initiated in 1977 by a non-governmental organization. With government backing, the program have now been extended to all the islands in the archipelago with satisfactory results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least all health centres offer child and maternal health services,&quot; says Djamila Cabral Afonso, the executive director of the Cape Verdian Family Protection Association, or Verdefam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, the isles infant mortality has been slashed by 50 percent in 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 25 percent of women within the procreation age bracket use contraceptives. This has led to a reduction in female fertility from more than seven children per woman a few years ago to five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Cape Verde's has been able to hold population growth to around 2 percent per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The progress achieved, so far, may be attributed to the short distances Cape Verdians need to walk to receive adequate medical care. Eighty percent of the population is located within an hour's walk from a dispensary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding these achievements and the fact that abortion has been legal since 1986, the problem of youth reproductive health continues to be a major worry for officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a long time, the health of adolescents was neglected as more attention was directed at mothers and children. But that is changing now as officials concentrate on the youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One major problems, health officials say, is that people in their early teens are sexually active. The officials told visiting journalists in October that this phenomenon was unsurprising since 30 percent of the women head their families. This is so because at least half the population lives abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of non-governmental organizations have joined with the government to combat the free sexual morality among teenagers. They have formulated radio sex education slogans which are aired several times a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your health, it is your responsibility, protect it,&quot; says one of the messages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdefam, now two years old, has created two youth information centers where teenagers can discuss their problems with qualified officials. However, neither many youths are visiting these centers nor frequently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the availability of legal abortions in virtually all hospitals and health centers, abortions are still performed secretly by unqualified medical personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal abortion has attracted as sharp criticism from the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human life needs to be defended on all occasions because it is the most sacred thing we possess,&quot; says Roman Catholic Rev. Arlindo Gomes Furtado of Our Lady's Parish in Praia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His preference is for love to be consummated &quot;within a spirit of communion and particularly within the security of a home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furtado says he strongly opposes the use of condoms which he describes as &quot; a mechanical instrument and a foreign body&quot; in the sexual act, which is &quot;very important, very intimate and total&quot; to the couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the condom should only be employed if one of the partners is sick and could infect the other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Uganda stands as the sub-Sahara African country with the highest teenage pregnancy levels, the government says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Statistics Department of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning released this in a Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey, whose results were officially released recently, shows that patterns of high fertility associated with &quot;low contraceptive use are rooted to teenage years of Ugandan women.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporting this finding, on Dec, 27 1996, the Center for Development and Population Activities in Washington D.C. said: &quot;overall, 43 percent of teenagers have begun childbearing, a disturbing finding because of its association with high morbidity and mortality for both the mother and child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey covered 7,070 women aged 15-49 years and 1,996 men aged 15-59 years and was financed by the United States Agency for International Development. Its objective was to obtain information on levels and trends of fertility, family planning knowledge and use, infant and child mortality and maternal and child health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey establishes that the relatively high level of fertility is due, partly, to an early start in unprotected sexual activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By age 15, almost one third (30 percent) of girls have already had their first sexual intercourse,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By age 18 years, it says, 52 percent of girls and 64 percent by age 19 years have had sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, 93 percent of teenagers (15-19 years) are not using any methods of contraception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, fertility in Uganda has declined slightly from 7.1 births per women over the last two decades to 6.9 births per woman for the period 1992- 94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If unwanted births could be avoided, the total fertility rate would be 5.6 children per woman,&quot; the survey says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the women, 15 percent of those married do not use contraceptives. Of these, 8 percent using modern ones while 7 percent were using traditional birth control methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the men, 10 percent use modern contraceptives and 15 traditional ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey shows that periodic abstinence remains the most popular method of control for both men (11 percent) and women (4 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), 6 percent of the men and 4 percent of the women interviewed reported having had a STD in the year prior to the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One third of both men and women who declared having STD took no action at all, while two thirds if men and three quarters of women sought treatment,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the survey reveals that virtually all men and women in Uganda know of AIDS, &quot;yet, over 3 percent of women and 11 percent of men had not changed their sexual behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most common change for both men (55 percent) and women (53 percent) is the restriction of sexual activity to one partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda is one of the states in east and central Africa most affected by the AIDS pandemic. At least 15 percent of Uganda's population of about 20 million live with HIV, the virus that causes the incurable acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a vigorous anti-AIDS educational campaign under the government of President Yoweri Museveni has stabilized the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's opposition National Party (NP) has accused President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) Government of steadily losing its grip on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new year's message to South Africans on Tuesday, NP leader Frederik de Klerk, claimed numerous government failures and warned South Africans that they would soon experience enormous disappointment with the Mandela government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The impression of a ship drifting downstream, apparently rudderless, is constantly compounded,&quot; De Klerk Said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that the government had failed to keep its promises on education, health, reconstruction and development, and privatization in 1996, and also highlighted the country's surging crime wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk, the country's last president, said local corporations had warned throughout the year that vehicle hijacking and armed robbery were spinning out of control, and were becoming a serious deterrent to foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also cited as ominous signs the plunge in the value of the South African rand, which dropped 30 percent against the United States dollar in 1996, and the continuing white brain drain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC displays a lack of vision for the country and for itself, and is in the grip of an identity crisis which is harming the country,&quot; De Klerk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Party is prepared to do its part through political cooperation,&quot; De Klerk added, &quot;but also through fearless criticism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white-led National Party -- which for decades in power practiced stringent racially discriminatory policies against blacks and other peoples of color -- withdrew from South Africa's Government of National Unity earlier in 1996, citing irreconcilable differences over the country's new constitution as the main reason.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said travellers who had bought these cheques before December 31, 1996, would still be able to cash them in 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to cease use of the cheques was reached in November 1996 at the governor's annual meeting in Maputo, Mozambique, following careful consideration of an independent report carried out by the firm, Coopers and Lybrand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The study established that although PTA travellers cheques had been of great benefit in promoting travel and... trade in the COMESA region during the pre-liberilisation era, their usefulness and level of utilisation had continued to decline as a result of the liberilisation process now taking place in all member countries,&quot; the Central Bank said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governors also resolved that the PTA Bank, in consultation with commercial banks and other economic operators would, in the future, examine the possibility of transforming the nature and ownership of the travellers cheque instrument into a regional credit card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decision is still to be made on the proposal presented to the governors after a series of comprehensive consultations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 20 states within COMESA but Mozambique announced Tuesday it was withdrawing from the grouping.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku has said the organization had succeeded in forcing member countries to respect democracy and the rule of law, but expressed concern about the delay by Nigeria to end military rule and release all political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his new year message, Anyaoku also listed other achievements made by the Commonwealth during 1996. These included the successful transition in Sierra Leone from military to civilian rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were the launching of a fund for private sector investment in Commonwealth member countries and joint support by the organization, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to alleviate the debt burden on developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nigeria, Anyaoku said the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, set up to monitor human rights, would continue to follow closely, that country's efforts to achieve democracy and greater respect for human rights in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria, which was suspended from Commonwealth membership by heads of government in New Zealand in 1995, remained a source of concern for the group, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria was suspended from the body after the execution of nine rights activists from the minority Ogoni people, among them the author, Ken Saro- Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hangings sparked a storm of international protests and the Nigerian authorities were accused of holding an unfair trial on trumped-up murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Commonwealth has been criticized for not taking tougher sanctions against the military leadership in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, the Nigerian opposition coalition accused a the Commonwealth's Action Group of failing in its mission to the country and propping up the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's mission, which visited the country for 48 hours, met with Nigerian leader Gen. Sani Abacha, leaders of five registered political parties as well as representatives of transition agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were no meetings with political detainees or the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyaoku, a Nigerian, welcomed democratic developments in various Commonwealth countries, such as Ghana, where free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections were held early December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will, therefore, be no room for complacency; we must remain ever alert to the needs of our members and defend the values which we stand for and support,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUTARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Tsitsi, a 16-year-old Zimbabwean girl, is already expecting a baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the child mother-to-be is not relishing the prospect of bringing a new life into a society she now feels has no mercy for its vulnerable members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsitsi, which ironically means &quot;mercy&quot;, was recently thrown out of the family home by her parents when they discovered she was pregnant. Her boyfriend denied responsibility for the pregnancy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this tender and impressionable age, Tsitsi has suffered mental trauma.  She has to cope with rejection from her parents, boyfriend and society at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel so used and humiliated,&quot; she says, stifling tears. &quot;The father of my unborn baby has refused responsibility and every one thinks I have loose morals, yet he forced me into it. This is very unfair and I do not even know where to start from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsitsi has now been forced to lead a life of begging on the streets of Mutare, Zimbabwe's third city on the border with Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times the girl gets a small allowance and food rations from the government's department of social welfare, but this is very little to meet all her needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She really has no choice but to live on whatever she lays her hands on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a helping hand is emerging for girls in Tsitsi's predicament, at least in Mutare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An association of women from inter-denominational Christian groups, which include the Catholic, Anglican and Methodist churches, has come to the rescue of girls like Tsitsi by setting up the Hagar Girls Home which opened early in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home, which accommodates jilted girls, also provides counselling services, skills training and tries to reconcile the girls with their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Services of a legal adviser are offered to try and have the responsible father pay maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairperson of the association, Margaret Machinga, says the establishment of the home was sparked by the alarming rate at which teenage pregnancies were rising in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our association decided to temporarily shelter the girls for at least a year while efforts to reconcile them with their families are made, instead of having the victims loitering around helplessly,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machinga says the objective was to reduce baby dumping, abortion and other problems associated with teenage pregnancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the period that the girls will be at the home we hope to equip them with motherhood and self-sustaining skills in preparation for responsibility,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem of young pregnant girls exists especially among those of school-going age who are rejected by society and are left stranded and at times homeless. In most cases the male will still be of school-going age or married, in which case the girl resorts to baby dumping, suicide, backyard abortion or becoming a street kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home, currently sheltering three expectant child mothers, relies on donations from members of the association, the social welfare department and other organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it can accommodate a maximum of eight girls, the home currently has limited facilities and authorities are appealing to well-wishers and companies in Manicaland province to help by donating in cash or kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The child mothers-to-be are already partly self-sustaining. They grow vegetables for their own use and sale to the local community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The World Bank has unveiled a new plan aimed at helping the sub-Saharan Africa fight poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan is contained in the bank's report entitled &quot;Taking action to reduce poverty in sub-Saharan Africa&quot;, just published.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan includes the need to increase focus on rural development, a concerted effort to organise macroeconomic policy and public expenditure, a systematic assessment of project investments to determine if they might be carried out by the private sector and continuing support of collaborative research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sub-Saharan region lags behind other regions because of political instability, weak state institutions, ineffective policies as well as low productivity in agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While East Asians increased their gross domestic product by 900 U.S.  dollars and South Asians by 420 dollars between 1970 and 1992, Africans saw an increase of only 73 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where South Asians could expect to see their 59th birthday and Latin Americans their 68th, life expectancy in Africa was about 51 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sub-Saharan Africa had also the lowest primary school enrolment and the highest infant mortality rate of any other region in the developing world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - The number of Mozambicans working in South African mines rose from 55,000 in 1995 to 57,000 in 1996, according to Mozambican Labor Minister Guilherme Mavila, cited in Thursday's issue of the daily paper &quot;Noticias&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavila said this is a reversal of a trend over the past two decades and was &quot;against all expectations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wages of migrant miners are an important source of foreign exchange for the Mozambican economy. For almost a century, southern Mozambique has been regarded as a labor reserve for South Africa, and prior to independence in 1975 more than 100,000 Mozambicans worked in South African gold and coal mines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the economic aspects of the apartheid regime's destabilization of Mozambique was the sharp reduction in the number of Mozambicans recruited to the mines in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mavila was pleased at the 1996 increase in Mozambican miners, he criticized the South African authorities for their discriminatory attitude towards migrants infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He confirmed that there have been cases of Mozambican miners expelled from South Africa because they tested HIV-positive. This was against the norms of the International Labor Organization, Mavila pointed out, which stress there should be no discrimination at the workplace against people infected with HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIV/AIDS is not a danger to other workers, since it can only be transmitted sexually or through contaminated blood. Mavila noted that the South Africans had not taken similar measures in the case of outbreaks of genuinely infectious diseases on the mines, such as meningitis, in which deaths had occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavila said the agreement on migrant labor between Mozambique and South Africa will shortly be revised. The agreement dates back to 1964 and was the work of the Portuguese colonial regime and the apartheid authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the aspects that the South Africans want to scrap is the system of &quot; deferred pay&quot;. Under this system, the miners only receive 45 per cent of their wages in South Africa: the rest is sent to Mozambique, where the miners can pick it up on their return. The money is sent to the Mozambican authorities in South African rands - a convertible currency - but the miners receive in the non-convertible local currency, the metical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavila defended this system on the grounds that the forced transfer of wages to Mozambique was a way of helping miners save, and it ensured benefits for their families. If this system were abolished, all the money would be likely to remain in South Africa, he warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - A old year is gone, a new year is born and with this transition African newspapers commented on the past and their hopes for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senegalese daily, Sud Quotidien, viewed the new year with gloom because of Africa's wars in Angola, Central African Republic, the Great lakes, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as with a woman in labor, it is difficult to predict what Africa's present hardships will lead to,&quot; it said. &quot;But one can still hope that Africa might emerge from this situation and give brighter prospects for its children.  &quot; Africa's wars, it said, were the result of the bygone East-West ideological rivalry. However, it added: &quot;It is up to men of goodwill to do their best so that the operation (for peace) succeeds. Africa has many such men. Herein lies its treasure, so does its future.&quot; Algerian papers confined their views to domestic concerns. La Liberte described the past year as one of &quot;tragedies and disillusionment.&quot; For example it said, despite government's optimism, acts of terrorism still occur and recent attacks were a &quot;glaring example&quot; of this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the economy, the newspaper said that the year had been one in which the public's purchasing power had deteriorated to the point that working class families were living in misery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the political arena, La Liberte said the public was disillusioned because the presidential election failed to bring with it an end to the violence in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Matin wrote in the same vein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Algerians were expecting improvement in their living conditions. They are disappointed. It is as well to ask ourselves what 1997 will bring,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another electoral year, perhaps a year full of dangers, of fireworks -- in the literal sense,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Watan, another Algerian paper, was also critical of the government's censorship of the press. Government, it said, had resorted to censorship in the name of fighting Islamic militancy but behind government's action was that harsh reality of &quot;strict management&quot; of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is very little room left for optimism,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Shares on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) ended the first trading in the year Thursday on a quiet note as the holiday mood continued to weigh down the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GSE All-Share Index shed 0.62 points to 360.14 points, down from its previous 360.76 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three equities recorded price changes, two gainers and one decliner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market capitalization also slipped to 2,596.29 billion cedis, down from Monday's 2,597.21 billion cedis close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total shares offered settled at 1,238,410 against bids of 552,410 with a moderate volume of 532,010 changing hands compared to the meager 28,910 traded on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the broader market, Unilever (UNIL) went down by 20 cedis to 780 cedis.  Social Security Bank (SSB) edged up three cedis to 1,060, while Pioneer Tobacco Company (PTC) gained two cedis to 135 cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market players say that &quot;business as usual is slow to take off just after the Christmas and New Year holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they said there was hope that the market would heat up in the coming weeks on clearer direction of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GSE Managing Director Yeboah Amoa predicted Thursday a buoyant stock market operation in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the development and installation of the latest technology of an automated central clearing system, new products such as the HFC Dollar Index Bonds and upgrading of the skills of market operators, were signs that the market would perform better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With this development, the GSE will soon become one of the best in Africa and the world at large,&quot; he told the Ghana News Agency in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GSE sold 35.7 million shares in 1996 valued at 27.8 billion cedis as against 55.8 million shares valued at 27.08 billion cedis in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This phenomenon is indicative of the fact that share values of listed equities are appreciating,&quot; he said. &quot;With improvement in the fight against inflation, we have seen share prices appreciate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even though the GSE All-Share Index registered a growth of 13.82 percent in 1996 as against 6.33 percent in 1995, there was a negative growth in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is still lower than the interest rate and it affects the market's operations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market, he added, was now safer with the right legal environment and appropriate technology. He said a Security Regulation Commission (SRC) equipped with highly trained staff was being developed to enforce integrity on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said, even without the SRC the market had worked with controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said companies listed on the stock market received additional premium and tax holidays as incentives. The listing of Ashanti Goldfields Company (AGC), which holds about 90 percent of the GSE's capitalization, had added momentum and a reputation to the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has expanded the GSE's Market Capitalization. However, it must not be taken as being responsible for the total performance of the market as the market can still perform better without it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following were the closing prices Thursday of listed equities quoted in cedis (1 U.S. dollar = 1,727.18 cedis): (ST) ABL 576 AGC 22,500 ALW 1,415 CFAO 20 EIC 430 FML 404 GCB 701 GGL 275 HFC 136 KBL 660 MGL 150 MLC 53 MOGL 5, 900 PAF 171 PTC 135 '2 PZ 370 SCB 5,000 SPPC 112 SSB 1,060 '3 UNIL 780 -20 UTC-E 50 (ET)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - Cholera killed 5,000 of the 80,000 people infected in 26 African countries last year, the United Nations agency, the World Health Organization, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's Africa office, in Brazzaville, said that Cholera was particularly severe in Sahelian countries of Africa and in several others in Central Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most affected states were Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Niger and Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the agency's Epidemics Division, Dr Antoine Kabore, told a news conference in Brazzavile on Thursday that the infection rate of cholera was 6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should reduce the rate further,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabore said the re-emergence of cholera aggravated the already deplorable health situation in sub-Sahara Africa, except South Africa. Besides cholera, meningitis and measles were the other epidemics which erupted in several African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the most fatal epidemic was the ebola virus-caused haemorrhagic fever in Gabon which killed 39 of the 52 cases diagnosed in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease also surfaced for the first time in Libreville, the Gabonese capital in December 1996, where it killed two people who had direct contact with ebola virus victims in northeastern Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Kabore said the disease was contained rapidly with assistance from the U.N. agency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said Friday that the continental body was seriously considering creating a peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference in Dar Es Salaam reviewing African events during 1996, he said the force could be created in a few months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the lack of resources had contributed to the delay in the force's creation. He would not disclose the projected strength of the proposed force nor the amount of money needed to support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If established, he said, each O.A.U. member country would be required to train a unit of its army in techniques of solving conflicts. The units would have to be ready for deployment on request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A continental force, he said, would have helped solve numerous conflicts in Africa like the one currently unfolding in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, who is on a six-day tour of Tanzania, said that political conflicts were among the most disturbing events which had occurred in Africa in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described as positive, the United States idea of creating an African force, now under consideration by the O.A.U. The idea has been supported by France which has often intervened on the continent in support of governments in several of its former colonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Salim said the O.A.U. would only take the U.S idea's practical aspects, without allowing the force to become &quot;a source of problems in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. idea, which the outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher tried to sell to African leaders in 1996, was met with mixed reaction during his African tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, which would likely be a key player in such a body, was initially lukewarm to the idea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Jerry John Rawlings is to be inaugurated on Tuesday in Accra as the first incumbent Ghanaian head of state to be re-elected since the country became independent from Britain nearly three decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana became the first black African country to become independent on March 6, 1957.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Rawlings and his political party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) , the scene will be a familiar one, having undergone a similar process in 1992 when they won power as the first government of the Fourth Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, the NDC swept into the House with 188 seats after some opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary elections. The significant opposition was National Convention Party, which obtained eight seats, while the Eagle Party got one seat. Three other seats went to independent candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that is set to change this time with a better showing of the opposition in the December 1996 parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the NDC still has a majority with 133 seats, which is just about two-thirds of the House, it will face strong challenge from 60 parliamentarians who belong to the New Patriotic Party, five from the People's Convention Party and one from the People's National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Rawlings, it will set him up as the longest reigning head of state since independence. By the time his next four-year term ends, he would have ruled for 19 years, 11 of them as military ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, ruled for nine years, while Gen. J.  A. Ankrah and Lt.- Gen. A.A. Afrifa ruled for less than three years between them. Kofi Abrefa Busia (two-and-a-half years), Gen. Ignatius Kutu Acheampong (seven years), and Hilla Limann, two-and-a- half years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Twenty six Somali political groups have accused the faction led by Hussein Aideed, the son of the late Gen. Mohamed Farah Aideed, of using funds secured from banana production and marketing to fuel the war in Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups, which concluded eight weeks of talks last Friday at a Sodere resort center in Ethiopia, 125 km south-east of Addis Ababa, accused Hussein and his late father of illegally levying taxes and service charges on local banana growers, to secure funds to prolong the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusation is contained in a resolution titled &quot;The role of bananas in the war in Somalia&quot; released in Addis Ababa on Monday, three days after the political groups signed a peace agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups identified the money earned from bananas as &quot;the main cause for the prolongation of the war and the suffering of our people in Mogadishu and the adjacent areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aideed faction was not represented at the Nov. 22 to Jan. 3 talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting's objective was to bring about an all-inclusive provisional government in Somalia, which has had no recognized authority since the fall of the late President Siad Barre's regime six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution strongly condemned what it termed as the &quot;outrageous conducts and abuse of banana funds for detrimental purposes against the interests of the Somali people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appealed to the European Union (EU) and other concerned parties, in particular the Italian government, to desist from supporting Somali individuals that had secured illegal banana concessions and their parent companies abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were identified as the &quot;Sombana&quot; which has ties with the Italian firm &quot;Denadai&quot; and the American company, Dole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution urged the EU, the Italian government and others to refrain from &quot;serious breaches of the banana industry and business norms and procedures, and to review their concessions and financial backing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political groups asked those firms to &quot;consult and negotiate in due course with the newly established National Salvation Council of Somalia, on the question of banana production and business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The deputy commander of the United States forces in Europe, Gen. James Jamerson, arrived Dakar Sunday for talks with Senegal on her participation in the Washington-proposed African Rapid Reaction Force for settling conflicts on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ready to talk and listen to all of Senegal's suggestions...on the configuration of the African Reaction Force,&quot; he said, as reported Monday by the government daily newspaper, Le Soleil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamerson is in Dakar for a two-day official visit. He said Senegal would have to determine the strength and conditions under which her soldiers would serve in the proposed 10,000-strong force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senegalese news agency, APS, reported Monday that Ethiopia, Mali, Senegal, Tunisia and Uganda had confirmed, in writing, their willingness to provide troops for the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it did not say to whom this confirmation was made: whether it was to the Organization of African Unity, United Nations or the United States Government. The objective of the force would be to provide Africa with a short-term capability to tackle a massive humanitarian crisis. The force would be trained and equipped by the U.S. It would cost between 25 million and 40 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1996, the outgoing U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, made a week-long visit five African states, seeking support for the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, asked Christopher to consult with the continental body, Africa's foremost political grouping. South Africa said the proposal was best tabled before the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference in Dar Es Salaam on Friday, O.A.U. Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, said the organization was seriously considering the creation of its own peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This O.A.U. force, which would comprise military units of all member states and would come under the control and command of the body, appears different from the U.S. proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim described as positive the U.S. proposal, but said that the O.A.U.  would only adopt the practical aspects of the U.S. idea, without allowing the O.A.U. force to become &quot;a source of problems in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana became the first black African country to become independent on March 6, 1957.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Rawlings and his political party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) , the scene will be a familiar one, having undergone a similar process in 1992 when they won power as the first government of the Fourth Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, the NDC swept into the House with 188 seats after some opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary elections. The significant opposition was National Convention Party, which obtained eight seats, while the Eagle Party got one seat. Three other seats went to independent candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that is set to change this time with a better showing of the opposition in the December 1996 parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the NDC still has a majority with 133 seats, which is just about two-thirds of the House, it will face strong challenge from 60 parliamentarians who belong to the New Patriotic Party, five from the People's Convention Party and one from the People's National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Rawlings, it will set him up as the longest reigning head of state since independence. By the time his next four-year term ends, he would have ruled for 19 years, 11 of them as military ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, ruled for nine years, while Gen. J.  A. Ankrah and Lt.- Gen. A.A. Afrifa ruled for less than three years between them. Kofi Abrefa Busia (two-and-a-half years), Gen. Ignatius Kutu Acheampong (seven years), and Hilla Limann, two-and-a- half years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Twenty six Somali political groups have accused the faction led by Hussein Aideed, the son of the late Gen. Mohamed Farah Aideed, of using funds secured from banana production and marketing to fuel the war in Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups, which concluded eight weeks of talks last Friday at a Sodere resort center in Ethiopia, 125 km south-east of Addis Ababa, accused Hussein and his late father of illegally levying taxes and service charges on local banana growers, to secure funds to prolong the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusation is contained in a resolution titled &quot;The role of bananas in the war in Somalia&quot; released in Addis Ababa on Monday, three days after the political groups signed a peace agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups identified the money earned from bananas as &quot;the main cause for the prolongation of the war and the suffering of our people in Mogadishu and the adjacent areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aideed faction was not represented at the Nov. 22 to Jan. 3 talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting's objective was to bring about an all-inclusive provisional government in Somalia, which has had no recognized authority since the fall of the late President Siad Barre's regime six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution strongly condemned what it termed as the &quot;outrageous conducts and abuse of banana funds for detrimental purposes against the interests of the Somali people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appealed to the European Union (EU) and other concerned parties, in particular the Italian government, to desist from supporting Somali individuals that had secured illegal banana concessions and their parent companies abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were identified as the &quot;Sombana&quot; which has ties with the Italian firm &quot;Denadai&quot; and the American company, Dole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution urged the EU, the Italian government and others to refrain from &quot;serious breaches of the banana industry and business norms and procedures, and to review their concessions and financial backing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political groups asked those firms to &quot;consult and negotiate in due course with the newly established National Salvation Council of Somalia, on the question of banana production and business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The deputy commander of the United States forces in Europe, Gen. James Jamerson, arrived Dakar Sunday for talks with Senegal on her participation in the Washington-proposed African Rapid Reaction Force for settling conflicts on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ready to talk and listen to all of Senegal's suggestions...on the configuration of the African Reaction Force,&quot; he said, as reported Monday by the government daily newspaper, Le Soleil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamerson is in Dakar for a two-day official visit. He said Senegal would have to determine the strength and conditions under which her soldiers would serve in the proposed 10,000-strong force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senegalese news agency, APS, reported Monday that Ethiopia, Mali, Senegal, Tunisia and Uganda had confirmed, in writing, their willingness to provide troops for the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it did not say to whom this confirmation was made: whether it was to the Organization of African Unity, United Nations or the United States Government. The objective of the force would be to provide Africa with a short-term capability to tackle a massive humanitarian crisis. The force would be trained and equipped by the U.S. It would cost between 25 million and 40 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1996, the outgoing U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, made a week-long visit five African states, seeking support for the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, asked Christopher to consult with the continental body, Africa's foremost political grouping. South Africa said the proposal was best tabled before the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference in Dar Es Salaam on Friday, O.A.U. Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, said the organization was seriously considering the creation of its own peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This O.A.U. force, which would comprise military units of all member states and would come under the control and command of the body, appears different from the U.S. proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim described as positive the U.S. proposal, but said that the O.A.U.  would only adopt the practical aspects of the U.S. idea, without allowing the O.A.U. force to become &quot;a source of problems in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The CFA franc lost ground on the United States dollar after gaining against the greenback last week in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Dakar's Citibank, the CFA exchanged at 513 (buying) and 543 (selling) to the dollar on Tuesday, as against 509 on December 31 and 510 on December 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Ghanaian cedi remains stable despite a lack of consensus among Ghanaian dealers on the evaluation of their foreign exchange needs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some were expecting a &quot;stable market&quot;, dismissing the likelihood of higher foreign currency demand, the Ghana News Agency, GNA, reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said that other dealers reported that rising revenues would allow them to renew their stocks and meet consumer needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday in Accra, the cedi rose slightly to exchange at 1,760 (buying) and between 1,750 to 1,800 (selling) to the dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cedi remains near its level at Dec. 31, 1996, according to the interbank rate made public by the Ghanaian banking association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cedi exchanged at 1,726 at the end of 1996 before falling to 1,726.82 (buying) and 1,735.36 (selling) on Jan. 6, 1997 in the Ghanaian capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's opposition alliance of political parties has accused the government of subverting the independence of the country's churches by planning to have President Frederick Chiluba ordained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Tuesday, the Zambian News Agency said that the National Lima Party publicity secretary, Stanfold Hlazo, described the decision by some church leaders as a mockery of the Christian community in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlazo said that government had wasted a lot of money in donations to ailing churches while the agricultural sector had been hard hit by high prices for fertilizers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the opposition alliance, Rodger Chongwe, termed some church leaders on Tuesday as hypocrites and accused them of being financially dependent on the state as their sole source of funds and recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe said the call by some church leaders to ordain Chiluba was also a danger to the development of democracy in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe said the stance by the divisive churches only confirmed the fears of those who opposed the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The very fact that Reverend Chintala, a Christian from a born again sect, was appointed to head the church ministry makes us believe that the call to ordain President Chiluba as reverend was conceived inside state house,&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a signal of intensification of religious fundamentalists,&quot; Chongwe added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said it was notable that orthodox churches, like the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of God had not supported calls for Chiluba's ordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Chiluba has never gone to theological school. How do you ordain him?&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe claimed that the state made a priority of subverting the independence of the churches and had done so by providing &quot;huge financial donations&quot; concealed in the treasuries of the churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop John Mambo of the Church of God has dissociated his church from the move to ordain Chiluba. Bishop Mambo has appealed to other church leaders to distinguish between mere politicking and the role of the Church in society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A Lusaka High Court Judge, Justice Kabazo Chanda, released 53 suspected criminals Tuesday, most of them facing charges of aggravated robbery, because they have not been brought for trial since their arrest in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chanda freed the suspects and said more would follow if reports prove true that police have been holding many others for years without being brought to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The releases were ordered in a special court session to which representatives from the Prison Service, Police and the chambers of the Director of Public Prosecutions were summoned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the occasion, Corporal Ernest Lombe of the Prisons Service said that the suspects were detained between December 15, 1992 and November 29, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lusaka Division Criminal Investigations Officer, Teddy Nondo, blamed magistrates and the suspects for the delays in trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nondo said that there was a tendency for magistrates to sign detention warrants before police had a chance to complete investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Flying Squad of the police and other units just picked up and locked up suspects without first charging them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nondo said, also, that some suspects elluded trial by refusing to answer to their names when called for court sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding this, Justice Chanda said there was need to uphold human rights in Zambia because every suspect was innocent until proven guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspects clapped, ullulated and sang hymns to praise to God and Justice Chanda for their freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state has no evidence before you and that is why they have kept you for five years in prison,&quot; he said, &quot;but do me one favour; do not go back and commit other crimes.&quot; Chanda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he warned that suspects would be re-arrested if police establish that they committed a crime. At the same time, he told police not to defy his order by re-arresting the suspects immediately after their release.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - First the good news: For the decade beginning in 1996, the annual economic growth rate for Sub-Saharan Africa is projected at 3.8%, double that for the decade that ended in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This welcome increase reflects improved commodity prices, the return to peace in several countries on the continent, and increased investment and productivity in many. Statistics for 1995 show that it was the first year of positive per capita income growth since 1989, and 1996 is expected to turn out even better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new aggregate growth refutes the stereotype of a consistently gloomy outlook for the continent. There are, however, many sobering qualifiers. The World Bank estimates that growth rates less than 6% will not significantly reduce poverty in most countries. While 12 African countries achieved this target in 1995, 41 did not. Food intake per person in Sub-Saharan Africa was estimated last year at just 87% of daily requirements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's share of foreign direct investment continued to fall, from 10% in 1987-1991 to 3.6% in 1995. Meanwhile, global concessional aid flows, on which Africa is particularly dependent, continued their decline. While 1996 saw the approval of a new scheme for greater debt reduction for heavily indebted countries, it was unclear how many countries would actually benefit from it in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, as the World Bank now concedes--echoing the longtime view of critics--&quot;economic growth is necessary but not sufficient for reducing poverty.&quot; Even in countries praised for their economic reforms and growth rates, most people continue to struggle for survival under precarious conditions. Funds for investment in infrastructure and human development, essential for long-term advance, are squeezed by &quot;market-oriented&quot; budget constraints throughout the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace and Security Issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries cannot progress economically in the absence of basic physical security. In many countries, security is threatened by open conflict, physical displacement or arbitrary abuses by repressive regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The multifaceted crisis in the Great Lakes region and Zaire, which made headlines in 1996, remains deadly. Open war also continues in the Sudan, and peace settlements in both Liberia and Angola could easily give way to renewed violence. In Algeria there is no end in sight to the violent conflict pitting extremist Islamic rebels against repressive government forces, in which both sides have targeted civilians and the lives of journalists are particularly at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cases such as the Great Lakes, the scale of crisis simply overwhelms local capacity to respond. There is a growing consensus, contrary to the Organization of African Unity's general assumption in past decades, that internal conflicts are not just the concern of one country. Neighboring countries and indeed the continent at large are victimized by spillover effects. Genocidal violence is in theory--if not yet in practice--the concern of the entire human community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet consensus on the need to &quot;do something&quot; is unlikely to lead easily to agreement on who should do what. The crises mentioned above, and perhaps new ones, are certain to confront Africa advocates this year with hard questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In African countries not suffering open warfare--i.e. the vast majority-- civil society continues to expand its role in demanding respect for human rights, democratic governance, and attention to a wide range of specific issues. But advocates typically work in a climate of domestic repression and international indifference. The most prominent case in 1997, as in 1996, is likely to be Nigeria, where the military regime shows no signs of responding to demands for democracy and respect for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, the new democratic system is well established. The extension of the Truth Commission's amnesty deadline into this year makes it likely that revelations about past abuses will continue. The country faces formidable problems, however, as it seeks to reconcile demands for economic growth with the need for equity in a society still fundamentally defined by the class and race hierarchies of the apartheid era. South Africa has yet to define a clear foreign policy that includes constructive participation in African issues as well as relationships with global economic powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues This Year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington the political climate will likely remain extremely difficult for advocacy on Africa. The reelected Republican majority in both houses of Congress will continue to press for cuts in international affairs budgets, ranging from development assistance to U.N. funding, the World Bank's International Development Association, peacekeeping operations, and other international agencies. The Clinton Administration, moreover, is likely to be inconsistent in its support for such budget commitments, despite its success in ousting U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Congress the retirement of Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.) removes two of Africa's most prominent allies on the legislative front. While there are sympathetic lawmakers in both the Senate and House, it will be an uphill battle to build even a modest core of members ready to speak out regularly on Africa issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from regular budgetary issues, there will be discussion of the African Growth and Opportunity Act introduced by Representatives Crane, Rangel and McDermott last year. The bill is designed to promote US trade and investment in Africa, but there is debate about whether it takes a balanced approach to development and reciprocal economic ties or fosters a one-sided stress on market-led growth and free trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, African issues are unlikely to receive much more attention from Washington in 1997 than in 1996. In many cases, however, relatively small shifts in US policy can have substantial impact on African or multilateral initiatives. The following is a brief checklist of some specific areas and issues on which US involvement may make a difference this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict (Great Lakes and the Horn): With the return of the majority of Rwandan refugees from Zaire and Tanzania, the interlocked crises in this region are for the moment focused primarily within rather than between borders. Rwanda faces the massive challenge of integrating the refugees and establishing functional legal procedures for coping with the aftermath of genocide. The future of Zaire and the refugees remaining there is unpredictable, except for the certainty that the conflict is not over.  Burundi's minority military regime is still under sanctions from regional countries, and massacres of civilians continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War rages on in southern Sudan, and the repressive Sudanese government is under increasing challenge in the north as well. There is, nevertheless, little immediate prospect of decisive military shifts or revival of stalled mediation efforts. The conflict has spawned an ongoing humanitarian crisis, and Sudan's neighbors could yet be drawn into the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace agreements (Liberia and Angola): The peace process in Liberia is formally on track again after its violent collapse in April 1996. But key steps such as disarmament of faction forces are not yet implemented, and a new collapse is easily possible in 1997. In Angola the United Nations peacekeeping force is scheduled to withdraw by mid-year. On paper the demobilization of Unita forces is complete, but observers warn that as many as 20,000 Unita troops are still operational. Insecurity is pervasive in the countryside, and there is a real threat of renewed open warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratization (Nigeria and other countries): The internal and international campaign for democracy in Nigeria will continue, given the failure of the Abacha regime to offer more than token promises of change.  Neither Western nor African countries are likely soon to take additional steps to increase pressure on the military regime, however, unless there is a dramatically visible escalation of the crisis. Pro-democracy efforts in most other countries are even less likely to attract major international attention and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landmines: The Clinton Administration will have to decide soon whether to join Canada and other countries in pressing rapidly for a total ban on anti- personnel landmines or continue deferring to the Pentagon's opposition to quick action on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International institutions: Like his predecessor, incoming U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is a highly skilled diplomat from the African continent.  But the spectacle of the transition, engineered unilaterally by the United States, was not encouraging. Substantive issues were absent from the debate, save for the code-word &quot;reform,&quot; generally understood as a euphemism for downsizing. This will be a critical year for US relations with the U.N. and other multilateral institutions. Unless the pattern of the last few years changes, the negative consequences for Africa will be substantial.</SPAN></P>

Influx of Zairean and Burundian refugees into Kigoma region continues at the rate of 1,000 per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Rwanda a) Total number of refugees who returned to Rwanda in 1996: 617, 200 from Zaire; 475,000 from Tanzania; 88,000 from Burundi; 8,000 from Uganda (UNHCR figures). WFP food assistance has been provided to all returnees. b) FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment mission estimated food aid requirements for the first half of 1997 are 81,000 tons of cereals and 33,000 tons of pulses, to cover needs of 2.571 million people (one-third of the population).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Burundi a) Insecurity in northern Cibitoke province halts missions to the province. Shots fired in the direction of the WFP Twin Otter flight path along the Kiriba forest of Kayanza. Heavy fighting in some areas of southern Bujumbura Rural and the border area of Bururi province. b) Increasing number of mine explosion leads to ban by UN Security Cell on travel on non-asphalt roads of Bujumbura Rural, Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces. WFP assessment and distribution missions affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ETHIOPIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) Special Report on the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment mission to Ethiopia issued on 16 December. Recent crop of 12 million metric tons of cereals and pulses is 20 percent higher than good harvest of last year. b) Cereal prices dropped with general anticipation of a bumper crop. c) Food deficient areas exist throughout the country, due to displacement, structural inadequacies and lack of access/entitlement to food supplies. Some 1.9 million people will still require food assistance, for total needs of 186, 000 metric tons, most of which is covered by carry-over stocks and pledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. Afghanistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) WFP interim policy, as of 24 December 1996: in addition to continued but reduced levels of activity in the north, work of WFP in Southern and Eastern Afghanistan will be exclusively in the areas of: humanitarian relief (including bakery projects); institutional feeding; projects where women or girls comprise 50 percent or more of the direct beneficiaries; food-for-seeds in cooperation with FAO; and selected food-for- work (in health, water and sanitation projects, de-mining activity and certain other categories). WFP activities will be in areas where WFP/NGO female staff, international and national, are allowed to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. ZAIRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Kisangani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) WFP continues to fly in food and relief materials to Kisangani by a Zairean chartered 707, from where it is moved either by road or by a locally chartered aircraft to Lubutu/Tingi-Tingi. Since the inception of the flights on 18 December to 1 January, WFP flights have moved in a total of 332 metric tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) WFP has begun another air operation, consisting initially of twenty flights with an Andover aircraft (capacity 6 metric tons), between Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi, Amisi or Shabunda. The destination will vary depending on the needs and security situation in each area. This aircraft will also be available to move relief materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) WFP has proposed that logistical coordination and prioritisation for food and non-food cargo in this part of Zaire be achieved through a UN Joint Logistics Centre in Kisangani, along the lines of the successful UN Joint Logistics Centre in Entebbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) On 28 December, WFP provided food for 2,000 internally displaced persons in Kisangani, making available 4 metric tons of maize meal, 1.68 metric tons of peas and 0.28 metric tons of oil. Distribution was carried out by the Norwegian NGO CEPZA, and CARITAS. Total food distributed by WFP is 135 metric tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Tingi-Tingi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) On 27/28 December, WFP carried out a second distribution to refugees in Tingi-Tingi (49 metric tons of maize meal). Two trucks carrying a total of 16 metric tons of maize meal were sent by WFP from Kisangani to Lubutu/Tingi- Tingi on 2 January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) As of 31 December, the UNICEF Nutritional Centre had 100 children in a therapeutic feeding programme and 300 children in a supplementary feeding programme in Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) Estimated number in need in the area: Lubutu/Tingi-Tingi 160,000, Amisi 30,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Shabunda: Prior to the evacuation of international staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from Shabunda, ICRC had counted 56,000 refugees in Shabunda from Rwanda and Burundi (no breakdown of figures available). To facilitate access to the refugee site from the airport, ICRC constructed an 80 metre long wooden roadway across the existing bridge.  Since ICRC's departure, information on the Shabunda area has not been available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Goma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Reports of refugees hiding in the thick forest near Tongo continue. The refugees are said to fear attacks from armed men roaming the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) WFP continues its operation of distributing high-energy biscuits to refugees in the Goma area returning to Rwanda. From 25 December 1996 to 1 January 1997, some 6,343 persons received WFP biscuits, with the beneficiaries consisting of 789 refugees, 2,330 Zairean internally displaced persons and 3,224 recipients in hospitals and nutritional centres. Monitoring of the hospitals and nutritional centres is carried out on a daily basis by WFP in conjunction with the agencies involved in the health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Bukavu: High-energy biscuit distributions continue, mostly on the northern axis from Bukavu, which is the area in greatest need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 With the vast majority of the Rwandan refugees having returned to Rwanda from Tanzania by 30 December, Tanzania currently accommodates approximately 248,000 registered refugees. The breakdown is as follows: 80, 000 Burundian refugees in the Ngara region; 130,000 Burundian refugees in the Kigoma region; 38,000 Zairean refugees in the Kigoma region. The influx of Zairean and Burundian refugees into the Kigoma region continues with some 1, 000 arriving per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 An estimated 475,000 Rwandan refugees repatriated from Tanzania to Rwanda in 1996. Some Rwandan refugees remain both scattered in Tanzania and at the holding centre for intimidators at Mwisa camp. The exact numbers are uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Following the repatriation of the Rwandan refugees, WFP retrieved its food commodities from the Rwandan camps in the Kagera region. This food, which consists of approximately 600 metric tons, will be distributed to the remaining Burundian and Zairean refugee caseloads in the Ngara and Kigoma regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 WFP airlifted 40 metric tons of corn-soya blend (CSB) and high-energy biscuits from Entebbe to Kigoma for distribution to the new arrivals and targeted beneficiaries. A total of 1,000 metric tons of CSB procured in Nairobi is being despatched to Kigoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 According to UNHCR, the total number of refugees who returned to Rwanda in 1996 is as follows: 617,230 from Zaire; 475,000 from Tanzania; 87,922 from Burundi; 7,998 from Uganda. WFP food assistance has been provided to all returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 Conclusions of the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (Special Report dated 23 December 1996): Food aid requirements for the first half of 1997 are estimated at 81,000 tons of cereals and 33,000 tons of pulses, to cover needs of 2.571 million people, or one-third of the projected population. The number of beneficiaries includes recent returnees who were not engaged in farming during the 1997 A season, previous returnees who will have to leave farm areas they are presently occupying, groups such as widows, elderly people living alone and orphans made vulnerable by civil strife, and population structurally vulnerable due to a poor resource base. WFP pledges for the first semester of 1997 are sufficient to cover the needs, however further pledges will be required for the second semester of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 A useful summary of the food situation in Rwanda and other countries in the region, entitled &quot;Overview Paper: Food Security in East and Central Africa&quot;, dated 23 December 1996, is available from DHA/IRIN Fax: +254 2 622129 e-mail: irin@dha.unon.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 WFP is currently in the process of finalising a Workplan for 1997, in close consultation with other UN agencies and involved parties. A Consolidated UN appeal for the Great Lakes Region will be launched shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Although only partial information was available on the security situation of much of the country, many areas remain clearly unsafe. Missions to Cibitoke province have been halted owing to insecurity in the northern area of the province. Shots were fired in the direction of the WFP Twin Otter aircraft's flight path along the Kiriba forest of Kayanza. The southern part of Bujumbura Rural and the border area of Bururi province are reported unsafe and some areas have witnessed heavy fighting, with rebel attacks leaving a reported 70 dead in Rumonge commune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 In view of the escalation in mine explosion incidents, the UN Security Cell forbids travel on non-asphalt roads of Bujumbura Rural, Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces, affecting both assessment and distribution missions by WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 The WFP Burundi caseload totalled 133,150 from 23 to 29 December.  Included in this total were 71,316 beneficiaries of emergency relief distributions and 32,611 returnees benefiting from the WFP returnee package.  This returnee ration is provided to returnees (refugees who have returned to Burundi) and displaced persons who are returning to their homes or are resettling permanently elsewhere in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 WFP and other UN agencies are actively working together to render possible food transport on Lake Tanganyika from Kigoma to Bujumbura. Out of the some 2,500 metric tons import allowance to Burundi by the RSCC (Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee), 1,000 metric tons would then be routed from Isaka to Ngozi and the balance by Lake transport, to permit both good geographical pre-positioning of commodities within the country and limitation of overland transportation costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ETHIOPIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE - Extracts from the recent FAO/WFP Mission report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 A Special Report on the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment mission to Ethiopia, issued on 16 December, describes the recent crop of cereals and pulses as 20 percent higher than last year's very good harvest. (Total production: some 12 million metric tons.) Early, plentiful and well distributed rains throughout the year not only encouraged planting and supported crop development in most zones, but also provided optimal conditions for draught animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Cereal prices, which have been declining steadily in most markets throughout the year, fell further with the onset of the harvest signalling the general anticipation of a bumper crop. The Mission stresses that given the fact that maize prices, in particular, were by November near or below production costs in the main production areas, efforts need to be made to improve marketing possibilities to avoid surpluses becoming a disincentive to producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 In spite of the comfortable national production figure, there exist traditionally food deficient zones in various parts of the country (parts of Wollo, parts of Tigray, and North Omo) due to displacement, structural inadequacies and lack of access/entitlement to food supplies. Some 1.9 million people will still require food assistance. Overall food aid requirements are estimated at 186,000 metric tons, 64 percent of last year's requirements, but most of this total is covered by carry-over stocks and pledges, leaving a balance of 15,110 metric tons to be resourced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The Mission recommended that all food aid should be met by local purchases and that no food aid should be imported. In addition, the Mission recommended that donors should seriously consider financial support for the purchase and export of Ethiopian grains (maize and sorghum) to neighbouring countries such as Kenya, Eritrea and Somalia, where similar FAO/WFP Missions have reported large deficits. Such action, as well as making logistical sense, will assist in establishing a floor in the Ethiopian grain market and reduce the possibility of the expected surpluses remaining unsaleable and becoming a disincentive to agricultural production next year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A statement issued by Zaire and Kenya yesterday after talks between Presidents Mobutu and Moi stressed that national sovereignty, territorial integrity, inviolability of national boundaries and citizenship issues were not negotiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-day meeting in Gbadolite, Zaire, was aimed at briefing Mobutu on the decisions taken by an African leaders' summit in Nairobi last month, which Zaire failed to attend. Kenyan radio reported that the Zairean side stressed its priorities were to &quot;sustain the war effort to put an end to the major obstacle in the occupation of a portion of Zairean territory by the enemy&quot;. The joint statement said another priority was to &quot;put the finishing touches to the democratisation process in respect of the electoral agenda&quot;.  The two leaders deplored the international community's &quot;indecisiveness&quot; regarding the Great Lakes situation and its failure to implement UN Security Council resolutions on the deployment of a multinational force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to AFP, a former Zairean information minister and currently a member of parliament, Anicet Kashamura, has announced his decision to join the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire.  AFP said he made the announcement during a visit to Paris where he called on foreign powers, especially the USA, France and Belgium, to support rebel leader Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An investigation has opened into a German company suspected of exporting arms illegally to Burundi, after customs officers at Brussels airport last month seized engines from former Soviet armoured vehicles, gearboxes and other parts from the Fahrzeugwerke Neubrandenburg firm. A spokesman for the court in Neubrandenburg said the company was suspected of trying to export the goods illegally to Burundi through Belgium after a request for an export licence was turned down by the German authorities in October. However the firm has denied the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundi's political parties are to take part in a national debate on January 27. The minister for institutional reforms Eugene Nindorera announced that the four-day debate would include about 60 people from across the political spectrum. However the main Hutu rebel group, National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), will not be invited to take part. The debate will cover five main themes: 1.the causes of the world's divisions and wars 2.  the peace process and reconciliation in Africa 3.the nature of the Burundi conflict 4.past debates on national unity and the democratisation of Burundi 5.steps to resolve the Burundi conflict. Burundi radio said a special envoy of US President Bill Clinton arrived in Bujumbura yesterday but the reason for the visit was not yet known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Eight assailants died and one was captured after &quot;infiltrators&quot; exchanged fire with Rwandan soldiers in Ruhengeri prefecture over the weekend, Rwandan radio reported. It said one soldier and an unknown number of civilians were also killed. The gunmen apparently hid in someone's house and their intention was to free prisoners from a local jail and force local leaders to give them identity cards. Weapons were captured from the attackers. On Sunday night, a family of six and three children were killed by gunmen in Gitarama, the radio said. IRIN yesterday reported that similar incidents had occurred in the Gisenyi area last month, in which at least 10 people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) resumes in Arusha, Tanzania, on Thursday with the trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu. A Tribunal spokesman told AFP that Akayesu, who has already changed lawyers twice, would now be defended by Nicholas Tiangaye, a barrister from the Central Africa Republic who once represented CAR dictator Jean-Bedel Bokassa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The authorities in Arusha yesterday ordered the seizure of public transport buses operated by refugees, in a bid to step up efforts aimed at forcing illegal aliens out of the country. The regional administrator, quoted by AFP, accused the refugees of &quot;masquerading&quot; as businessmen to avoid repatriation. He said most foreigners were engaged in the transport business.  Local officials were given a month to impound all buses owned by refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR repatriation figures for 1996 showed that a total of 1,300,582 refugees returned home last year. Of these, 719,307 returned from Zaire, 483, 445 from Tanzania, 88,309 from Burundi and 9,521 from Uganda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The CFA franc lost ground on the United States dollar after gaining against the greenback last week in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Dakar's Citibank, the CFA exchanged at 513 (buying) and 543 (selling) to the dollar on Tuesday, as against 509 on December 31 and 510 on December 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Ghanaian cedi remains stable despite a lack of consensus among Ghanaian dealers on the evaluation of their foreign exchange needs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some were expecting a &quot;stable market&quot;, dismissing the likelihood of higher foreign currency demand, the Ghana News Agency, GNA, reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said that other dealers reported that rising revenues would allow them to renew their stocks and meet consumer needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday in Accra, the cedi rose slightly to exchange at 1,760 (buying) and between 1,750 to 1,800 (selling) to the dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cedi remains near its level at Dec. 31, 1996, according to the interbank rate made public by the Ghanaian banking association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cedi exchanged at 1,726 at the end of 1996 before falling to 1,726.82 (buying) and 1,735.36 (selling) on Jan. 6, 1997 in the Ghanaian capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's opposition alliance of political parties has accused the government of subverting the independence of the country's churches by planning to have President Frederick Chiluba ordained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Tuesday, the Zambian News Agency said that the National Lima Party publicity secretary, Stanfold Hlazo, described the decision by some church leaders as a mockery of the Christian community in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlazo said that government had wasted a lot of money in donations to ailing churches while the agricultural sector had been hard hit by high prices for fertilizers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the opposition alliance, Rodger Chongwe, termed some church leaders on Tuesday as hypocrites and accused them of being financially dependent on the state as their sole source of funds and recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe said the call by some church leaders to ordain Chiluba was also a danger to the development of democracy in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe said the stance by the divisive churches only confirmed the fears of those who opposed the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The very fact that Reverend Chintala, a Christian from a born again sect, was appointed to head the church ministry makes us believe that the call to ordain President Chiluba as reverend was conceived inside state house,&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a signal of intensification of religious fundamentalists,&quot; Chongwe added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said it was notable that orthodox churches, like the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of God had not supported calls for Chiluba's ordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Chiluba has never gone to theological school. How do you ordain him?&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe claimed that the state made a priority of subverting the independence of the churches and had done so by providing &quot;huge financial donations&quot; concealed in the treasuries of the churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop John Mambo of the Church of God has dissociated his church from the move to ordain Chiluba. Bishop Mambo has appealed to other church leaders to distinguish between mere politicking and the role of the Church in society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A Lusaka High Court Judge, Justice Kabazo Chanda, released 53 suspected criminals Tuesday, most of them facing charges of aggravated robbery, because they have not been brought for trial since their arrest in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chanda freed the suspects and said more would follow if reports prove true that police have been holding many others for years without being brought to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The releases were ordered in a special court session to which representatives from the Prison Service, Police and the chambers of the Director of Public Prosecutions were summoned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the occasion, Corporal Ernest Lombe of the Prisons Service said that the suspects were detained between December 15, 1992 and November 29, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lusaka Division Criminal Investigations Officer, Teddy Nondo, blamed magistrates and the suspects for the delays in trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nondo said that there was a tendency for magistrates to sign detention warrants before police had a chance to complete investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Flying Squad of the police and other units just picked up and locked up suspects without first charging them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nondo said, also, that some suspects elluded trial by refusing to answer to their names when called for court sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding this, Justice Chanda said there was need to uphold human rights in Zambia because every suspect was innocent until proven guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspects clapped, ullulated and sang hymns to praise to God and Justice Chanda for their freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state has no evidence before you and that is why they have kept you for five years in prison,&quot; he said, &quot;but do me one favour; do not go back and commit other crimes.&quot; Chanda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he warned that suspects would be re-arrested if police establish that they committed a crime. At the same time, he told police not to defy his order by re-arresting the suspects immediately after their release.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Southern African Development Community (SADC) member-states have collected over 5,000 samples of mainly traditional food crop seed species in the region for preservation at the sub-regional plant genetic resources center in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center's director, Godwin Mkamanga, told PANA on Wednesday that the samples were just part of the 50,000 species the center intended to preserve for posterity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project is part of the SADC food security strategy and is aimed at saving traditional food crops which, he said, were threatened with extinction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have stored samples of seed for some 5,000 varieties of traditional food crops under scientific conditions. It is intended that these will remain alive for planting even after one hundred years from now,&quot; Mkamanga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the preserved seeds are cereals, legumes and vegetables. They include maize, sorghum, millet, groundnut and their wild and weedy edible species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legumes include cassava, sweet potato, and yam varieties in addition to vegetable plants like okra, pumpkin, water melon, eggplant (aubergine) and cucumber varieties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center was established in 1989 by the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, the predecessor of the current 12-nation SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its objective was to coordinate the inventory, collection, characterization, evaluation and utilization of plant genetic resources in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also tasked with the establishment, over a 20-year period, of a network of local germplast programmes in member-countries and support plant research in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center is also responsible for conservation of other plant genetic resources, apart from food crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkamanga said the center was currently liaising with national plant genetic resources centers to establish national field gene banks for various indigenous fruit trees which could not be saved in seed form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are encouraging the various affiliate centers in all the member- countries to plant useful local fruit trees as a matter of priority as part of the food crops preservation programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seed samples are dried so that they retain only between five and seven percent moisture content. They are then sealed in specially designed bottles and placed in deep freezers at a temperature of minus 20 degrees centigrade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkamanga said that almost all the SADC countries were losing some of the traditional food crops in the wake of modern hybrid seed being developed by commercial companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea of preserving the traditional food crops is meant to act as insurance against possible failure of modern seeds in case of adverse weather conditions,&quot; he said, citing the 1990/91 drought which had caused widespread shortages of food in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With seed reserves like the one we are setting up, we could serve the situation by releasing the traditional seeds,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (PANA) - Four leaders of Nigeria's five authorized political parties, currently visiting the United States, have condemned the latest bomb explosions in Lagos, describing them as a terrorist acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's bomb blast, which occurred near a bus filled with soldiers, killed two servicemen and injured several people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosion was the fourth in the city in the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday at a press conference in New York, the political leaders vowed that such acts would not stop the efforts to return the country to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will make sure this does not stop us from achieving our goals,&quot; said Gambo Lawan, chairman of the Grassroot Democratic Movement, one of the five political parties registered by Gen. Sani Abacha's military administration as part of a phased political transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isa Mohamed, the chairman of the United Nigeria Congress Party, called on the international community to condemn the explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders urged the U.S. to support the transition programme and stop &quot; financing&quot; some people claiming to be fighting to bring democracy to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now in Atlanta, the next stop in an itinerary which will also take them to Miami, Houston, Kansas City, Chicago and Washington D.C.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana began his second four-year term Tuesday by extending an olive branch to his political opponents, saying his government would promote dialogue and reconciliation with the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope the efforts that the executive or the ruling party for that matter will make will find an appropriate response from the minority parties in the supreme interest of our nation,&quot; he said in Accra after his inauguration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings was sworn-in before an open air parliament and a large crowd at the seaside Independence Square in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in rich Kente cloth with white jumper to match he took the oath of allegiance and the presidential oath which were administered by Chief Justice Isaac Kobina Abban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings, &quot;dialogue should not be a one-way affair, where the government is expected to bend over backwards to accommodate the opposition, while the opposition on its part surrounds itself with a barrier that prevents them from hearing any other views but their own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President urged the opposition to demonstrate that their public posturing on reconciliation are not just keeping with the political fashion of the moment but that they are ready to back their works with deeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This must also apply to the media especially those newspapers with close affinity to the opposition. Without respect, humility, tolerance and restraint, reconciliation will be difficult to achieve,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President added: &quot;We should not seek to endlessly provoke others and we must learn to be a little more positive in our approach to issues and more constructive in our criticisms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged Ghanaians to find within themselves the spirit that allows them to break down the acrimony of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings has become the longest serving head of state since Ghana gained its independence from Britain on March 6, 1957. He first came to power through a military coup d'etat on June 4, 1979. He handed over power to an elected government in September, 1979, but seized power again on December 31, 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, he was elected for the first time in a popular vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Mosaflorestal, a joint venture between Mozambican and South African Companies, has agreed with the government in Maputo that its planned eucalyptus plantation will not be sited in the environmentally sensitive district of Matutuine, in the far south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The managing director of Socimo, Francisco Caravela, one of the Mozambican partners in Mosaflorestal, told the country's news agency, AIM, Wednesday that all of Mosaflorestal's shareholders have accepted the government position that, on environmental grounds, the project cannot go ahead in Matutuine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was discussed with us and we have reached a position that is positive for all sides,&quot; Caravela said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of the plantation is to provide raw material for the South African pulp and paper industry. Forty percent of Mosaflorestal is owned by Sappi forests, which is a subsidiary of the giant South African company, the Anglo- American Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mozambican government has said that it is not opposed to a eucalyptus plantation as such, and the Mosaflorestal project can go ahead elsewhere in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not found another area for the project yet but we're working on it with the government,&quot; Caravela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosaflorestal is liaising closely with the agriculture ministry and the planning and finance ministry and Caravela said a solution would be reached within a few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists objected strongly to plans for a eucalyptus plantation in Matutuine, because this is one of the most important areas in southern Africa in terms of biodiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eucalyptus -- native to Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania -- demands large amounts of water. The plantation would, therefore, lower the water table and alter, radically, habitats in the region with a consequent loss of indigenous fauna and flora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has decided that Matutuine should be the site for a major eco-tourism project, proposed by the right-wing American millionaire James Blanchard III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blanchard used to channel large amounts of money to the RENAMO anti- government forces, supported by apartheid South Africa, during its war against the government in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blanchard project is to be developed over an area of 236,000 hectares.  There has been much talk of an investment of 800 million U.S. dollars in this project but the Maputo daily newspaper, Noticias, on Tuesday scaled this down to 20 million dollars of &quot;direct investment.&quot; This is supposed to attract further capital up to a total of 800 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blanchard is promising to build casinos and luxury hotels for rich tourists, who will be able to stroll on Matutuine's unspoiled beaches and view its wildlife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - TO the untrained eye, South Africa, or the Bafana Bafana, as they like to call themselves, are a very strong side-what with the Africa Cup of Nations resting in Nelson Mandela's residence and the world soccer governing body, FIFA, granting them the status of the highest -ranked African team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, without any claim at expertise in soccer, I do not think the Bafana Bafana, in the present form-with a team full of aging players are that better than say-Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and worse off, Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take their 30-year-old goalie, Arendse. Those that watched him win his place during the Four Nations last year would admit that faced with lethal drives from goal-hungry strikers like Yekeni and our own Mwape Miti, Andrew Tembo and Jonson Bwalya, Andre Arendse would be taken in ill with impromptu whooping cough. He is not the sort of goalkeeper a serious team will depend on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor does the presence of Sizwe Motaung, their right-full back give any support to poor Andre. The Swiss-based Sizwe, to say the least, is only good in attack, and if he is given a hefty and aggressive winger like either Andrew Tembo and Jonson Bwalya, you would have clipped his wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while he has a regular place at Leeds, Lucas Radebe, his biggest weakness is that he takes years to recover once beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is however, Mark Fish, who unfortunately spends half his time as a tourist at his new club at the competitive Italian Serie A, side, Lazio, who is a capable defender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As their youngest player, Fish, is however, over-used because he is the only player with the energy to play as an attacking defender, -which sometimes makes him play to the gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To check him Mwila should field a strong and tested midfield comprising of course Charles Musonda and someone like say, Jonson or Andrew at position six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bafana skipper, Neil Tovey, has great ability to read the game, and can be instrumental in various moves. He has a good fighting spirit but he too has little know how on managing a neat midfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he has nothing great left in him to stop the bullets from the Chipolopolo The Bafana Bafana midfield of Linda Buthelezi, Shaun Bartlet and Erick Tinkler, can at times be deadly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Buthlelezi's ball-controlling skills are a horror. He has earned more red and yellow cards than all Zambian players together in the last five years.  Underpressure the panicky man in him lets loose and can earn Zambia clear free kicks and at the most a penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masinga, who last season was unceremoniously sidelined at English side, Leeds, is what some can confidently call a chancer, fights less for the ball and wait to be fed. Cutting the supply mid way will frustrate him through out the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;new kid&quot; on the Bafana Bafana bench, Skosana, is a right inclusion at the wrong time because if his performance against Mufulira Wanderers is anything to go by, he only needs the likes of Allan Kamwanga, to continue sizing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There isn't that much gold left in the Bafana mines anymore. If any, its the steam, stamina and running. We can use skill, experience and maturity to spank their infancy and whack their overgrown pride.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - GOAL-scoring skipper, Kalusha Bwalya, whose arrival yesterday boosted confidence in the Zambian camp, declared he would lead Zambia to a clear victory against South Africa's Bafana Bafana in the World Cup qualifier slated for Independence Stadium this Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview shortly after his arrival from his Mexican base, Kalusha, dressed in a blue suit, with a Chipolopolo scarf on his shoulders, however, warned that the match will not be easy as the South Africans have improved in the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ready to lead the rest of the players to the World Cup and I feel that we have the players to win the match. I cannot make any predications as to the outcome of the match but I am ready to play,&quot; said the skipper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how he felt about the presence of his longtime mate, Charles Musonda, Kalusha said he was glad that his friend was around to play against South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am willing to play with any players and since I played with Charles before, I do not see any problems, I only hope we can achieve something on Saturday,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said he believed with the experience they have, Fred Mwila and Samuel 'Zoom' Ndhlovu are capable of leading the team to its first-ever World Cup appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be playing to win but one thing we have to know is that South Africa has improved and they are a good side,&quot; said Bwalya, who arrived on the same plane with his young brother Joel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Joel, speaking in an interview at the airport, insisted that the important thing on Saturday would be for Zambia to clinch even a 1-0 win so as to be at par with the rest of the teams in the Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This game is important in that it will determine if we will still have chances of playing to qualify, and that is why as at now, I think the best we can do is force even a 1-0 win so that we work hard in the tougher match against Zaire,&quot; said Joel, dressed casually in a black jeans suit with some fancy black footwear and a piece of cloth on his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally I feel I am ready for this match and I am only looking forward to join the rest of the players in training,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel plays his club football in Belgium.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, the Committee To Protect Journalists (CPJ) to His Excellency President Frederick Chiluba President of the Republic of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to condemn in the strongest terms the arrest of George Jambwa, a journalist for the privately owned newspaper &quot;Chronicle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jambwa was arrested and detained on December 26 for trespassing into the Army Barracks while attempting to verify reports that Zambia's Army Commander, Lieutenant General Nobby Simbeye, was under house arrest. On December 30, Jambwa appeared before the Lusaka Magistrate Court to answer to charges of &quot; criminal trespass&quot; under section 306 of the Penal Code where he pleaded not guilty. He was released later that day on bail of ZK 50,000 (US$ 38), with two sureties each of the same amount. The trial is set to begin on January 21, 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ condemns the arrest of Jambwa as a grave attack on press freedom and a blatant violation of his right to hold and express opinions and ideas. We respectfully remind Your Excellency that Zambia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 19 of which guarantees the right to &quot;seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kind.&quot; These rights are also guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights; and the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press, all to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Zambia is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We strongly urge Your Excellency to do everything in your power to dismiss the charges against Jambwa and ensure an environment where journalists can work freely and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lusaka, Cairo Road is festooned with youth's selling things ranging from calendars, plastic shopping bags through scarves to regalia such as T-shirts and robes in Zambian colours.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average price for most items is K3,000 with the most expensive being a Zambian flag get-up going for K45,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tailor at the City Center Market, Eugene Kopa, says he has made over half a million Kwacha over the last two weeks selling Zambian flags which he is offering for K15,000 each while Agnes Kaira, a Chilenje compound resident claims to have made &quot;a fortune&quot; by knitting scarves in Zambian colours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am selling the scarves for K3,000 each and people are buying them like hot cakes,&quot; Kaira said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the hottest selling item is a T-shirt going for K5,000 which has &quot; Zambia for 1998 France World Cup&quot; emblazoned on the front while &quot;See You There!&quot; adorns the rear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are definitely qualifying for the world cup,&quot; remarked one confident fan, Charles Mulenga, as he purchased one of the T-shirts. &quot;I want to wear this T-shirt when we teach South Africa a football lesson on Saturday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipolopolo fan club chairman, Elijah Chisanga, has urged all soccer lovers to make a bee-line for Lusaka's Axis Center and Kafue Wholesalers or phone 247767 in Lusaka for Chipolopolo scarves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All Chipolopolo fan club members should be in Zambian colours on Saturday,&quot; Chisanga said. &quot;We don't want South Africa to score a single goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motorists meanwhile have also refused to be counted out. They have hung Chipolopolo scarves inside their cars and occasionally flash out four fingers to pedestrians, indicating a 4-0 win over South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - INITIAL weather forecasts indicate that it will rain on Saturday when Zambia meets South Africa's Bafana Bafana in a World Cup first leg encounter at Lusaka's Independence Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer-in-charge of the Central Forecast Office, Reidner Mumbi, disclosed in an interview yesterday that the heavens will definitely open up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been looking at the weather pattern for Saturday and indications are that it is going to rain,&quot; Mumbi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said if it rains heavily on Friday night then there is a fair chance that the rains will be reduced to a drizzle by kick-off time at 15:00 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is also a good chance that Independence Stadium will not be affected by the rains and even if it rains, the intensity will be reduced by the time the game kicks-off,&quot; added Mumbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But national team technical adviser, Samuel &quot;Zoom&quot; Ndhlovu said in a separate interview yesterday that &quot;rain or no rain the boys are ready for battle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have got the right boots to use if it rains,&quot; Ndhlovu said, adding: &quot; The boys are ready for battle, rain or no rain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, according to Ndhlovu, the Zambia national team is accustomed to playing in rainy conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did it in Mauritius, we repeated it in South Africa against Burkina Faso and we shall certainly do it against South Africa...unless the pitch is flooded,&quot; the highly reputed trainer bragged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - TWO South African pilots yesterday pleaded not guilty to a charge of flouting Zambia's aviation regulations by failing to communicate with a Zambian air traffic controller as required by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilots, Robin Anderson, 67, of Sunnyside, Pretoria and Mark Julian Main- warring, 29, of Johannesburg both accepted the charge proffered upon them but explained why they failed to communicate with Zambia aircraft control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were flying too low because of bad weather and so were unable to communicate with Zambia's aircraft controller,&quot; Anderson told principal resident magistrate Francis Nsokolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main-warring gave the same explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Nsokolo told them to come for trial on February 24, Main-warring hurriedly said: &quot;We accept the charge and would like to plead guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Nsokolo declined to accept their changed plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not your fault that the weather was bad so we will have to hear evidence on this. We cannot force you to plead guilty when it was not your fault,&quot; Nsokolo told the pilots upon which they agreed to come for trial as ordered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two are charged under section 57 (1) and (2) of the Aviation Act Cap 740 as read with section 5 (1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two were travelling from Lusaka International Airport to Botswana's Shokwe Airport on December 20 last year and were supposed to communicate with the Zambian authorities before take leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian authorities would then have communicated with their counterparts in Botswana to release the aircraft to their care.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - TRADERS in Northwestern and Eastern provinces have taken advantage of the raging fertiliser shortage to maximise their earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) in the two provinces have complained of being taken advantage of by traders, some of whom are now collecting K50,000 as down payment from helpless farmers in dire need of fertiliser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is this what the government meant by liberalisation? Where have they taken the fertiliser they bought? The ZNFU should demand an explanation on how the government has distributed its fertiliser,&quot; said Dick Moyo from Chipata's Luangeni constituency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And United National Independence Party Special Assistant to the vice- president, George Zulu, confirmed that he had also witnessed fertiliser being sold in 1kg packs going at K2,000 to K3,000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of fertiliser is obscene and scandalous. Investrust Bank is doing a good job in the Eastern province but some crooks have come on the scene, taking advantage of the shortage and farmers' poverty. They are repacking fertiliser into smaller packs and making more money out of the 50kg fertiliser bags,&quot; Zulu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samson Mbaku from Mufumbwe called on the President to intervene in the fertiliser crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a matter of national concern. We should be proud to feed ourselves as Zambians and not always rely on imports. It will not hurt the government to reduce on their profits. In the long run, it will benefit the country,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbaku said some crooks had managed to collect the little money a few farmers had with promises to deliver fertiliser from Lusaka in two weeks time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fertiliser never came and now they do not even have money to buy this government fertiliser which is yet to be seen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture minister Edith Nawakwi however, emphasised in a statement on Monday that the government prices would remain the same because they were competitive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - THE Supreme Court of Zambia has summoned The Post's special projects editor Masautso Phiri to appear before it for contempt of court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri has been charged for alleging in his column, &quot;A Post Card from Masautso Phiri&quot; of December 11, 1996 that seven Supreme Court judges were offered K14 billion to dismiss the opposition petition challenging President Chiluba's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the summons, Phiri is required to appear before the full Supreme Court bench to show why he should not be held in contempt of court over his article on the day the petition between the opposition and President Chiluba will first be heard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let Masautso Phiri attend before the Supreme Court Building on the day the above petition will first be heard before the full Supreme Court in 1997 at 09:00 hours to show why you should not be held in Contempt of Court on your article which appeared in The Post issue No. 619 Wednesday December, 11. 1996 under heading &quot;Praising God Loudly&quot;, the summon signed by the Master of the Supreme Court M. Masilinda read in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the second summons to Phiri over the same article-the first being by Vice-President Brigadier General Godfrey Miyanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his complaint before Senior Resident Magistrate Gertrude Chawatama, Miyanda alleged that Phiri who was the first respondent and The Post Newspapers as the second &quot;published defamatory matter contrary to section 191 of the Penal Code, affecting the complainant.&quot; The Miyanda case comes up on Friday morning for plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the criminal libel case involving President Chiluba's Zairean girlfriend failed to take place yesterday because defence lawyer Sakwiba Sikota was appearing in another matter before the High Court and one of the accused Fred M'membe was still out of the country because of flight problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate Betty Musonko adjourned the case to Friday afternoon for the start of cross- examination of prosecution star witness Clementine Mutshinga Mununga. The prosecution reluctantly agreed to the adjournment but insisted on the earliest date for the resumption of trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And several NGOs perceived to be critical of the MMD government have been omitted from the list of participants which was compiled by the Community Development ministry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a source disclosed that the meeting is expected to discuss the modalities of forming a Council to oversee the activities of all NGOs in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community development permanent secretary Helen Matanda who has been sending out invitation letters to participants refused to answer queries concerning the seminar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) chairperson Lucy Sichone said that her organisation has been left out because of its critical position on national issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also expressed concern over government's interference in the activities of NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should the government discuss the policy framework on behalf of the NGOs,&quot; Sichone asked in an interview yesterday. &quot;What they have done in this particular case is to leave all NGOs which they have perceived of being outspoken and critical.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - THE Electoral Commission has set the date for the Itezhi-tezhi by- election following the death of MMD area member of parliament Luminzu Shimaponda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Executive director for the electoral commission Joel Sikazwe said in a statement released in Lusaka yesterday that the polls will be held on February 20, 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aspiring candidates should lodge nomination papers and statutory declaration on January 30, 1997 at the Itezhi-tezhi sub-council offices,&quot; Sikazwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition Zambia Democratic Congress(ZDC) have already indicated that they are not participating in the by-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of our application in the High Court is that we shall not participate in any election based on the NIKUV register. It therefore does not make sense for us to condemn the system and then contest the elections using the same system we have condemned,&quot; said Mung'omba in an interview on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP boycotted the controversial November 18,1996 presidential and parliamentary elections insisting that the NIKUV register was fraudulent, designed to give an in-built majority for the ruling MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission chairman Bobby Bwalya said the Nikuv registers would not be changed until the year 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikazwe said aspiring candidates should take along with them nine supporters who must be registered voters in the Constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The supporters must have in their possession the Green National Registration Card and voters cards and the aspiring candidate will be required to pay K20,000 non-refundable nomination fee,&quot; Sikazwe said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effect will be achieved through a statutory instrument which is currently being drafted by the Ministry of Legal Affairs, confirmed Harrington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) would be responsible for checking that investors had complied with the requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECZ would also be the final authority regarding the approval of an assessment study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ECZ will make sure that projects do not have an adverse impact on the environment. There is a serious commitment on our part to implement our environmental policy,&quot; said Harrington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister emphasised that this was an Environmental Impact Adjustment scheme which would now be set in motion to protect future generations' inheritance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ben Mukusi, a local timber trader, wondered where investors would get qualified environmental damage assessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously this work will be done by the ECZ and is just another way of collecting revenue. To reduce the chances of corruption, the government should carry out the assessment free of charge,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - PRESIDENT Chiluba has asked the church to define the functions and purpose of the religious desk he has set up at State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba opened the religious desk and named a deputy minister and reverend Peter Chintala to be in charge of it when he announced his cabinet last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of church leaders calling itself the consultative committee continued to meet in Lusaka yesterday to draft a mission statement for the desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultative committee is being assisted by officials from Cabinet Office's management strategic planning unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee which begun its meetings on Monday was expected to come up with the final policy framework of the desk by late afternoon yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the committee include Zambia Episcopal Conference (ZEC) secretary general Father Ignatius Mwebe, Pastor Reutter from Gospel Outreach and several pastors from Pentecostal churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moderator of the Reformed Church, Reverend Foston Sakala who is also part of the committee meeting at Gospel Outreach (GO) Centre in Lusaka, hinted that the focus of the committee has been to ensure that the desk plays the role of a facilitator for dialogue between the church and the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverend Sakala said he was happy government had consulted the church over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was my own view that having established the desk, it was necessary to ask concerned people what they would want it to be so that the state does not impose anything on us,&quot; Sakala said in an interview at GO centre yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - PIONEER of Kwela and Township Jive, Dorothy Masuka known to her millions of fans as &quot;Auntie Dottie&quot;, has quietly slip-ped into the country from her base in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with The Post yesterday, the 70-something diva said she was in the country to visit her family and friends.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have my children here and a lot of friends I left behind at the time I left this country in 1986,&quot; Masuka said in that familiar Southern drawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masuka hit fame in the 50's with her lilting girl-next-door songs which were later popularised by the woman refered to as &quot;Mama Africa&quot;-Mirriam Makeba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 70's, her fame heightened through her militant songs such as Musango and Zimbabwe Chaitora at the height of the Zimbabwean independence struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, however, did not amuse the rebel government of Ian Smith who consequently ordered her out of that country. She lived mainly in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to her departure for South Africa, she worked briefly as a Public Relations Manager at Livingstone's Fairmount Hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Zambia Broadcasting Services (forerunner to the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation) radio DJ, Matteo &quot;Mattie P&quot; Phiri, described Masuka's visit to Zambia as an honour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was among people like Mirriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela who shaped the music of Africa. She is a queen of music,&quot; the eccentric Phiri said in a separate interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According Masuka, who was born Dorothy Manyando Simasiku, arrangements are underway for her to hold a series of shows in Zambia sometime in April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masuka last performed in Zambia in 1989 at the former Ridgeway hotel, now the Holiday Inn Garden Court hotel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - UNIP chairman Malimba Masheke has charged that people condemning women who bared their breasts during his party's demonstration are courting violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those women were expressing their anger. That was much better than violence. People saying that that behaviour was wrong are taking a great risk.  They are courting violence,&quot; Masheke, who addressed the demonstrators said in an interview on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reacting to the growing condemnation which he claimed to have been orchestrated by the MMD government with President Chiluba joining the fray on December 30, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the audience at a swearing -in ceremony at State House, President Chiluba condemned UNIP for allowing ordinary women to bare their breasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope these are not signals that the first thing they will do, if at all they come to power, is to take pornography and nudity to Parliament. We have to protect our women,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President made his remarks during the swearing ceremony of deputy defence minister Mike Mlongoti and deputy finance minister Dan Pule, adding: &quot; If they cannot allow their wives to undress why allow ordinary women to do so? We have to dress ordinary people and move forward to uphold our morality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And agriculture minister Edith Nawakwi on the same day also strongly condemned UNIP telling the Times of Zambia: &quot;One can only hope and pray that the striptease in UNIP is not a reflection of the party's vision for Zambia because most women certainly prefer to keep their clothes on and continue with meaningful dialogue as opposed to exposing naked ignorance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added sarcastically: &quot;Such a grotesque display of worn out anatomy of elderly women certainly reflected UNIP's desire to remain in a time-warp back in the stone age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Masheke yesterday reminded Nawakwi that the &quot;worn out anatomy of elderly women&quot; is the reality of Zambia today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't have to go far. Even in information minister David Mpamba's village women move with bare breasts because that is the reality of today's economy. Besides, when people mourn whether in Namwala, Gwembe, Lundazi or even Isoka, they bare their breasts to show grief,&quot; Masheke said. &quot;The UNIP demonstrators were showing anguish because of the suffering they are going through.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Private agribusiness companies should helpdetermine the direction and pace of policy change in the current liberalized market, an agribusiness entrepreneur has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of the Zambia Grain Growers' and Marketing Association, who is also the interim chairman of the Southern Africa Agribusiness Federation (SAAF), retired Captain George Lloyd, said this when he officiated at a SAAF Founders meeting held in Harare, Zimbabwe, recently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As our economies continue to be liberalized, it is critical that the private agribusiness companies help determine the direction and pace of policy change, assist in operationalising new trade protocols and support the formation of new agribusiness ventures that will create employment, income and foreign exchange throughout the SADC region,&quot; Captain Lloyd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SAAF was conceived last year after 35 representatives of well-known agribusiness enterprises and associations from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Zambia and Malawi decided to form a body that will promote agribusiness trade and investment in all of the Southern African Development Conference (SADC) countries by facilitating private sector initiatives while guiding public support to the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The initial areas of activity for SAAF will be limited to policy analysis and advocacy, information collection, analysis, distribution and facilitation of agribusiness finance,&quot; Captain Lloyd said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the time-table worked out, SAAF will be legally constituted during the first quarter of 1997 and begin operating during the second quarter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, D.C. - Beginning January 7, 1997, The Corporate Council on Africa will lead a delegation of 42 senior representatives from U.S.  companies to the West African countries of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea. The Trade and Outreach Mission will feature talks with each countries' Head of State and local private sector business executives.  The mission marks the first time that the Corporate Council on Africa has embarked on such a venture to Francophone Africa -- a region that has traditionally been dominated by the French business community. According to the Council's Executive Director, David H. Miller, &quot;Africa has many thriving markets and the interest that this mission has generated definitely underscores the positive attitude that U.S. corporate executives have toward Africa. This mission is a statement that, despite the generally negative public image that Africa seems to possess in the American media, the continent is continuing to attract the American business community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While politically and geographically diverse, all three countries possess economic prospects. With an abundance of natural resources, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire offer many attractive business opportunities for U.S.  companies in several key sectors including petroleum, mining, forestry, and manufacturing. Substantial new oil deposits were discovered in Equatorial Guinea in 1995, and Congo and Cote d'Ivoire are beginning to open deep water acreage for hydrocarbon exploration. The governments of The Congo and Cote d'Ivoire have recently developed strategic structural adjustment programs in conjunction with the World Bank and the IMF. Also included in these development plans are economic reforms targeted at the reorganization and liberalization of their trade and investment policies. These programs are designed to make attractive markets for international entities and their implementation demonstrates the commi0tment these governments have to attracting foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of the Corporate Council on African Trade and Outreach Mission to The Congo, Cote d'Ivoire &amp; Equatorial Guinea is to introduce American business into this uncharted territory and to promote the virtues of free enterprise to these emerging markets. Trade and Outreach Missions promote the cross-cultural exchange of ideas and information between business and individuals and work towards forming the foundation for strong U.S.-African commercial ties. The Council believes that by fueling economic growth, new trade and investment in Africa has potential to contribute, ultimately, to the material well-being and prosperity of the African people, while improving U.S. commercial presence on this often overlooked continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanying the mission will be Congressman William Archer, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Congressman E. Clay Shaw, and senior representative from the State Department Africa Bureau. The sponsors of the mission are Motorola, Atlantic Telenetwork, Central African Foundation, General Motors, Occidental Petroleum, CMS Nomeco Oil &amp; Gas Company, United Meridian International Corporation, Equator Bank Limited, Mobil Africa and F.  C. Schaffer &amp; Associates. Other mission participants include: Citibank, West African Distributors, Inc., AT&amp;T, Cohen &amp; Woods International, Michael Baker Corporation, Anadarko Petroleum, IBM Africa, Navistar, Alexis International, ComsatRSI, Stewart &amp; Stevenson, International Trade Development Corporation, Adeerma Enterprises, Inc., and the Universal Marketing Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Corporate Council on Africa, established in 1992, is a non-partisan, tax-exempt membership organization of corporations and individuals dedicated to strengthening and facilitating relationships between African and American individuals and organizations by creating educational, cultural and commericial exchange opportunities. The Council believes that it can accomplish this goal by educating constituencies about the different social customs, traditions, and economic climates on both continents and by utilizing a network of business executives and government officials to promote U.S.-Africa relations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - When Zambia clashes with South Africa January 11 in a World Cup soccer qualifying match, the key factor at stake will be regional supremacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both teams believe they are the best side in the Southern African region, if not on the continent and the match in Lusaka is looked at as one that will put an end to the dispute.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, FIFA, the world soccer governing body, ranked Zambia as the best team in Africa with South Africa a close second, but in the latest ratings, South Africa has taken the top slot with Zambia now in second place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambians would like these positions to be reversed again and are confident that the South Africans will be beaten. Zambia, under a new coach (Fred Mwila, who recently replaced Rould Poulsen of Denmark) has called on all the professional players it can get. The South Africans have done the same. Both sides have also been promised handsome monetary rewards should they win.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Workers, the main target for taxes, are gripped by general anxiety about what the national budget has in store for them, given indications of increasing pressure on government's financial obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is feared that taxes directly affecting workers will be raised and the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions has told its members to brace themselves for hard times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the major concerns, is that the government could face difficulties in balancing the budget which should be announced at the end of this month.  About 25 % of the budget revenue comes from donor aid but it is not clear yet on which or how many donors have committed themselves to assist this year.  The Paris Club meeting at which donor pledges are expected to be made, was put off last month (December) and will now be held next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance deputy minister Dan Pule has, however, allayed the fears, saying that Zambia's programmes with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were still on course and that relations with the multi-lateral organisations were still intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the government has limited the number of students entering university to under 1,000 this year because it does not have the money to support all those who qualify. About 12,000 pupils qualified to enter university but government says it can only offer bursaries to about a 1,000 of these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the government also announced the scrapping of mature-age entrants to the university, contending that only those with appropriate academic qualifications would be allowed to enter the institution.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, however, not clear yet if the costs of increased college intakes would be met by the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - UNIP, the former ruling party, is facing financial problems that have led to the sacking of about 25 workers who allegedly protested for not being paid their salaries for four months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers were fired for misconduct after they closed off the entrance to their headquarters, Freedom House, in Lusaka. The party's administrative secretary Basil Kabwe said this was bad behaviour because the workers also closed out clients who rent some rooms in the UNIP building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the presidential and parliamentary elections last November, the party ran into another financial hitch when it failed to meet the costs of holding its general congress. The party president, Kenneth Kaunda, is said to have assisted in meeting the shortfall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The once dynamic Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) party has been reduced to near rubble following the November 18 election defeat. The party, which seemed good enough to give the ruling MMD a good run for the 150 parliamentary seats, could only manage two seats and this has dampened the spirits of many of its members, including its leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took close to a month for the once vocal party founder and president Dean Mung'omba to accept defeat but he and virtually all members of his executive have kept out of the public lime-light since the defeat. The only news coming out of the party, is a quarrel about who should lead the party on to the next elections in 2001.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) has demanded that government impose trade disadvantages on Zimbabwean companies tendering for Zambian government and parastatal business.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - This year's agriculture produce, especially maize which is the country's staple food, is expected to fall because many farmers cannot afford fertilisers needed for a good yield. Both the commercial farmers and the peasant farmers have complained that the prices of the fertiliser, imported through donor aid, were too high for them to afford and grow the desired amount of maize this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has said it cannot reduce the prices pegged at between K30,000 and K50,000 (about $23 to $40) because a targeted amount has to be realised to cover the cost of the importation. Government has also advised farmers to pass on the cost to the price of their produce. Many farmers may want to do this, but they cannot get the required loans to cover the cost because lending institutions are skeptical about the farmers' ability to repay loans, as was experienced last farming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia National Farmers Union has called on government to review its agriculture policies if the sector is to survive. The problem is compounded by poor logistics on how to transport the input to all parts of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Early last year, a smartly dressed wanted criminal walked into the casualty ward of the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka. He walked up to a bed on which lay a colleague who was shot and wounded by police two days earlier and pulled out a gun. At point blank range, he shot his colleague dead. A policeman assigned to guard the wounded criminal dashed to the scene only to meet a hail of bullet. He too died instantly as the gunman made his exit and fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towards the end of the year, a gang of bandits crept up to a police tent pitched by the roadside at a road-block and shot dead two policemen before they could reach for their weapons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In between these two incidents in 1996 the police have had numerous gun battles with armed robbers. Both sides have taken casualties but it is the daring attacks on police personnel that have stolen the limelight. This is also causing concern with the police who now have to contend with a much more brutal brand of bandits. The police have, however, been swift in countering direct attacks on their personnel. In the UTH shooting, the culprit was cornered within days in a rural town about 300kms east of Lusaka. He was brought to Lusaka but was not given a chance to appear in court as he died in police custody from injuries believed to have been received in the cells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of the two policemen in the Copperbelt Province was a couple of days later followed by an ambush by the police on an hideout of some bandits.  The bandits escaped into the night and are believed to have crossed into neighbouring Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in the year, Chief of Police Francis Ndhlovu stated that the police were in a much better position than ever before to contend with an evidently more daring and brutal clique of criminals. He also declared &quot;total war&quot; against bandits in an effort to reduce the crime rate in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has also constantly assured members of the public to remain calm in the wave of crime. Following the shooting of three policemen in two days on the Copperbelt last month, the region's deputy permanent secretary Thomas Chibanga, said members of the public should not worry because the law enforcement wings had the capacity to contain the crime scourge. According to police statistics, the war seems to be going in the favour of the police.  Last year, about 4,000 crimes were recorded, indicating a considerable drop from previous years when figures went beyond 7,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police public relations officer Francis Musonda notes that the decline in figures indicates that crime prevention is more effective now. In 1995, 5,867 crimes were recorded, in 1994 there were 7,013, in 1993 there were 7,148.  Aggravated robberies have topped the list of crimes in all years with 1,037 recorded last year. Almost each day an armed robbery is recorded, with, on some occasions, victims shot dead and women raped. Most of the robberies are of cars, usually snatched from the owners in ambushes. Many of the stolen cars are sold in neighbouring countries, especially Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources of guns used in the robberies have been another major source of concern for the police. It is generally suspected that most of the weapons used in the crimes are brought in from neighbouring Zaire. The criminals' frequent use of guns and attire similar to that used by the Zambian paramilitary personnel is, however, raising suspicion that some police personnel could be involved in the supply of the weapons to criminals or that they themselves carry out the crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the police, however, are of the opinion that some members of the public are suppliers of guns to criminals. This is despite the fact that it is difficult to legally own a gun in Zambia because of the red-tape and high licence fees. Last year, in an effort to reduce the number of guns illegally in the hands of the members of the public, the police offered an amnesty to all those who would surrender their guns. The response was poor despite two extensions and the police have kept the result secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent incident, however, seems to confirm that some policemen could be might be involved in crime. Police gave chase to a suspected car thief who ignored warning shots for him to stop. Instead he shot back at the police.  Eventually, he was shot dead and he turned out to be a son of a senior police officer. It is suspected that he got the weapon from a police sentry. And, in a twist of fate, the policemen involved in the shooting have been arrested and charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has also been an increase in crimes whose motives are either unknown or point to the victims being targeted for murder by hired killers.  Occasionally houses are broken into the homes and people killed without the contents of the house being disturbed. One such bizarre case was recorded in Chanyanya about 100kms south of Lusaka, where an old woman and two of her grandchildren were murdered in their house. Nothing in the house was touched.  In other incidents, motorists are shot at but the motive is evidently not to steal the vehicles. The latest outrage that is being committed by suspected hired killers is that of throwing strong acid onto the face and body of victims. Last month, two men were arrested after doing this. They claimed they had been hired for a fee of one million Chat (about 800 US dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline in crime is also attributed to the vigilance among members of the public, some of whom are increasingly taking the law into their own hands to deal with criminals because of lack of confidence in the police. A major issue that came up last year in the dealing of criminals was the stoning and burning to death of any suspect caught stealing. A more civilised manner of dealing with crime has been the proliferation of neighbourhood watch schemes in which people in a community take turns in patrolling their area with the assistance of the police. Areas with effective neighbourhood watch schemes have had very low crime incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest innovation has been the introduction of community policing in the commercial centre of Lusaka. The area had long been a haven for criminals ranging from pick pockets to armed robbers. Shop owners now operate together to repel the robbers and scheme is showing positive results as relative peace has returned to the commercial centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new year has began on another bloody note with the brutal killing of four wildlife officers who were trying to arrest illegal fishermen. This could be an indicator of another tough year ahead for policemen who are now just as vulnerable to attacks as any other citizen or resident of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Following Monday's denial by Paris, of French troops in the eastern town of Kisangani, Le Monde reported that retired Colonel Alain Le Carro, the former head of the French GSPR presidential security cell, and Robert Montoya former gendarme from the anti-terrorist cell are allegedly linked to the recruitment of mercenaries for Zaire. Both men denied their involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Monde reported that there were some 200-300 soldiers, dubbed the &quot;White Legion&quot;, stationed in Kisangani to train Zairian forces. Ten of their numbers are saided to be former French soldiers while others are alleged to be recruits from Belgium, Britain, Angola, Mozambique and South Africa. Le Monde said that their numbers are expected to increase significantly in upcoming weeks with the expected arrival of new recruits from Europe.The mercenary forces are expect to buy time for General Mahele to clean-up and reorganize Zaire's armed Forces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strongly denying any official involvement, a spokesperson from the French presidency told Reuters they had no knowledge of such a force. Another spokesperson from the French Defense Minister stated that the presence of former French soldiers &quot;could in no way infer that there was a link with French policy in the region.&quot; Although France is known to support President Mobutu, it is prevented by the international arms embargo on Zaire from providing military aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African security firm Executive Outcomes denied all involvement in the recruitment of soldiers; however, Le Monde claimed that some of the soldiers were recruited from among their numbers. Former Angolan rebel chief Jonas Savimbi also denied that his forces were assisting Zairian troops in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 7 January, rebel leader Laurent Desire Kabila told AFP that the Zairian army was carrying out &quot;very deep reconnaissance&quot; missions from Kisangani, some 500 km west of Goma, towards rebel held territory. In an interview with the Ugandan journal &quot;The Sunday Vision&quot; on 5 January Kabila also claimed that Zaire was using Hutu ex-FAR to fight ADFL forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Reuters report the Zairian government continues to rule out negotiations with ADFL rebel leader Laurent Kabila despite the fact that many politicians in Zaire are increasingly in favour of a peaceful settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While on a visit to Paris, the former Zairian Minister of Information in the 1960 government of Patrice Lumumba, and currently a member of the Zairian parliament, Anicet Kashamura, stated in a press communique that he has joined with rebel leader Kabila. Mr. Kashamura also called on the US, France and Belgium to support the ADFL against Mobutu's dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an address to soldiers the new army chief General Mahele claimed the army was waiting for a green light from President Mobutu to begin their counter-offensive. In stressing the point that the army would fight according to internationally accepted rules he stated, &quot;We will not harm civilians, our target is known.&quot; Residents in the rebel occupied territory have expressed anxiety over how Kinshasa would view those who remained in the area, as collaborators or an occupied population. Despite the semblence of normalcy in Goma, an AFP report indicated that several residents had fled or had made arrangements to flee in the event of a successful counter-offensive by Zairian forces. Analysts believe that Kinshasa's view of the civilians in the rebel held territory could impact on civilian loyalty in the event of a counter-offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Reuters reported that Kabila's ADFL has set up a training camp for new recruits at Rumangabo, 60 km north of Goma. Despite the training of several thousand new recruits they have yet to be incorporated into the core of the ADFL forces which remain predominantly Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a further effort to reign in its former allies the ADFL ordered the arrest of key Mai-Mai leaders. Star Radio, the ADFL mouthpiece, said the orders followed recent fighting between the Mai-Mai and ADFL forces. The Mai- Mai are composed primarily of teenagers grouped into units from their home areas. They have a strong belief in magic fetishes which they believe makes then invincible in battle. The alliance between Kabila's disciplined Banyamulenge troops and local Zairian warrior groups was disrupted by the recent return of President Mobutu to Zaire and the announcement of a counter- offensive by Zaire forces. Since then, the Mai-Mai have been involved in attacks on civilians and more recently against the ADFL forces. Over the last few weeks Kabila has announced various unsuccessful initiatives, including disarmament and retraining, to control the Mai-Mai violence. Reuters reported that the Mai-Mai continue to mutiny. In Butembo some 33 people, including 20 Mai-Mai warriors, were killed in fighting over the past week with alliance forces. Similar skirmishes were also reported in Rwindi and Bunia, 100 km and 360 km north of Goma respectively. Analyst believe that the internal conflict between the Banyamulenge and local ethnic groups allied to ADFL brings into question the strength of the alliance in the face of a possible Zairian counter-offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Kabila told AFP that he has been in regular contact with four unidentified foreign companies who have concessions in the Kilo Milo gold fields near Bunia, which fell to ADFL forces over Christmas. Kabila had issued an ultimatum to companies with mining concessions to resume operations by 3 January or risk losing them. To date, Kabila claims no company has resumed its activities because of &quot;warmongering in Europe&quot;. If they become operational they are expected to provide enough financing for the ADFL war effort and the payment of wages for civil servants in the occupied towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Over the weekend, Kenya launched an operation to round up alleged Rwandan Hutu militants. However, a police source told AFP that no arrests had been made to date and that the operation had been halted until 9 January. Recent reports indicated that several Hutu refugees had arrived in Mombasa from Tanzania. Other Hutu refugees are reported to have been operating businesses in Kenya since fleeing Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to the state-owned Ugandan &quot;New Vision&quot; on Monday, there was fierce fighting on Sunday between the UPDF and Ugandan ADF rebels in Kampasa, deep in the Rwenzori Mountains. The fighting is reported to have involved 1000 UPDF troops. Kampasa is about 40 kms from Bwera town, Kasese, high up in the mountains. The paper quoted a senior military commander as saying that Kampasa is 'the real ADF base'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Radio Burundi reported the arrival on 8 January of the US envoy to the Great Lakes Region in Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Two decades of efforts to control malaria have yielded little progress in reducing the intensity of the disease, which affects between 300 million and 500 million people each year in the developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa, the world's major parasitic disease kills more than one million children below the age of five years annually. Apart from tuberculosis, malaria is the leading transmittable disease that causes more deaths than any other.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organization (WHO) statistics indicate that 90 percent of the world's malaria-related cases and deaths occur in Sub-Sahara Africa.  According to experts, malaria mainly attacks children, pregnant women, non- immunized travellers, refugees, displaced persons and farm workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in view of the severity of the disease in Africa that health experts are in Dakar attending an international conference on malaria, which was opened Monday by the Senegalese president, Abdou Diouf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by the WHO says that malaria is a public health problem in at least 90 countries representing about 2.4 billion people, or 40 percent of the world population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the disease has been known since antiquity, it has remained as a serious public health problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria is transmitted through bites by the anopheles mosquito, which inject into humans single celled parasites called falciparium plasmodium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO malaria eradication campaigns have failed due to lack of money and because of the emergence of insecticide-resistant anopheles mosquitoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, instead of insisting on eradicating malaria, the focus is now to reduce the disease's mortality, morbidity as well as its negative economic and social impact. This change of strategy was recommended by an international conference on malaria held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in October 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria experts concede that the presence of drug-resistant mosquitoes, first observed in the 1970s, have complicated the treatment of malaria cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The malaria vector has managed to adapt to the insecticides which now in use. Because of this development, almost all programmes which were initiated to combat the vector in Africa have failed, except in some islands located far from the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the optimism raised by the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets has not proved to be the panacea. Consequently, experts say that more investments are required to fund malaria research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is much optimism that something new could emerge from the Dakar conference when it ends later today. The meeting was sponsored by the United States National Health Institute, European Union, the Pasteur Institute of Paris, France, and United Kingdom Medical Research Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference is expected to enable experts from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe to review the existing anti-malaria strategies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - A private South African security firm, Executive Outcomes, has denied allegations that it had deployed mercenaries in eastern Zaire and had, instead, called for a top-level investigation into charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released Wednesday in Pretoria, the company asked that the investigation be conducted personally by South Africa's National Police Commissioner, George Fivaz, and the director-generals of the South African Secret Service and the National Intelligence Agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent media reports had claimed that several hundred European and African mercenaries were assembling in eastern Zaire to help counter the advancing anti-government forces, known as the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports claimed that more mercenaries were expected to leave Europe later in January to join Angolan, Belgian, British, French, Mozambican and South African mercenaries in Zaire. The reports also claimed that Executive Outcomes was involved in the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the leader of Angola's former Unita rebel movement, Jonas Savimbi, has denied Banyamulenge claims that his forces are fighting alongside Zairian Government troops. The leader of the Banyamulenge forces, Laurent Kabila, claimed earlier this week that an unknown number of South African mercenaries and 2,000 Unita troops had joined 3,000 to 4,000 government troops in the central Zairean town of Kisangani to prepare for an assault on the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi said that all 65,000 of his troops, the number verified by the United Nations, are in Angola and are either being integrated into the national army or waiting to be demobilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am specifying with all my heart that we do not have one single man in Zaire,&quot; Savimbi said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - President Jerry Rawlings has expressed displeasure at refugees flocking into his country, saying they are becoming a burden on Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ghana welcomed people who contributed the country's economic development but was increasingly worried over immigrants who were a liability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said this Wednesday in an audience with Tambari Sanoussi, a Minister of State in Niger, who called on the president at the Castle, Osu, the official residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanoussi led his country's delegation to Tuesday's inauguration of President Rawlings and Vice-President John E. Atta Mills. Leaders of delegations from Benin, Guinea, Liberia and Togo, who attended the inauguration, also called on the Rwalings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Liberian refugees, who fled their country's civil war, Ghana is also saddled with economic refugees, mainly from neighbouring Sahelian countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said the best way to curb the influx of refugees from the sub- region into Ghana was for the governments of those countries to improve their economies and thus discourage their nationals from leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At another meeting, with Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan, Rawlings said that the sub-region was getting tired of its role in the war-torn country and might not go beyond the June time limit to withdraw peace- monitoring troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Abuja Peace Accord, the West African Peace Monitoring Group, or ECOMOG, will on Jan. 31, complete disarming Liberia's warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are scheduled for May and a President inaugurated in June to hopefully end the seven-year civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said that West African countries contributing troops to ECOMOG had pumped so much money into Liberia that they were getting exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's gone on for far too long, and we cannot go beyond the schedule. We are coming to the end of our tether,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses were testifying in Addis Ababa against 71 Derg members accused of genocide and crimes against humanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-five of the defendants are being tried in absentia. Among them is the former leader, Mengistu Haile Mariam, who fled Addis Ababa for exile in Harare, Zimbabwe, a few days before the collapse of his regime in May 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the witnesses spoke of the disappearances of close relatives who had been arrested at the height of the &quot;Red Terror&quot; campaign in Addis Ababa for anti-revolutionary activities. They were believed to have been executed, without trial, by the military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign was launched following an attempt to kill Mengistu in Addis Ababa in October 1976. He was then deputy chairman of the Derg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria is transmitted through bites by the anopheles mosquito, which inject into humans single celled parasites called falciparium plasmodium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO malaria eradication campaigns have failed due to lack of money and because of the emergence of insecticide-resistant anopheles mosquitoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, instead of insisting on eradicating malaria, the focus is now to reduce the disease's mortality, morbidity as well as its negative economic and social impact. This change of strategy was recommended by an international conference on malaria held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in October 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria experts concede that the presence of drug-resistant mosquitoes, first observed in the 1970s, have complicated the treatment of malaria cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The malaria vector has managed to adapt to the insecticides which now in use. Because of this development, almost all programmes which were initiated to combat the vector in Africa have failed, except in some islands located far from the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the optimism raised by the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets has not proved to be the panacea. Consequently, experts say that more investments are required to fund malaria research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is much optimism that something new could emerge from the Dakar conference when it ends later today. The meeting was sponsored by the United States National Health Institute, European Union, the Pasteur Institute of Paris, France, and United Kingdom Medical Research Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference is expected to enable experts from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe to review the existing anti-malaria strategies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - A private South African security firm, Executive Outcomes, has denied allegations that it had deployed mercenaries in eastern Zaire and had, instead, called for a top-level investigation into charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released Wednesday in Pretoria, the company asked that the investigation be conducted personally by South Africa's National Police Commissioner, George Fivaz, and the director-generals of the South African Secret Service and the National Intelligence Agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent media reports had claimed that several hundred European and African mercenaries were assembling in eastern Zaire to help counter the advancing anti-government forces, known as the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports claimed that more mercenaries were expected to leave Europe later in January to join Angolan, Belgian, British, French, Mozambican and South African mercenaries in Zaire. The reports also claimed that Executive Outcomes was involved in the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the leader of Angola's former Unita rebel movement, Jonas Savimbi, has denied Banyamulenge claims that his forces are fighting alongside Zairian Government troops. The leader of the Banyamulenge forces, Laurent Kabila, claimed earlier this week that an unknown number of South African mercenaries and 2,000 Unita troops had joined 3,000 to 4,000 government troops in the central Zairean town of Kisangani to prepare for an assault on the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi said that all 65,000 of his troops, the number verified by the United Nations, are in Angola and are either being integrated into the national army or waiting to be demobilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am specifying with all my heart that we do not have one single man in Zaire,&quot; Savimbi said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - President Jerry Rawlings has expressed displeasure at refugees flocking into his country, saying they are becoming a burden on Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ghana welcomed people who contributed the country's economic development but was increasingly worried over immigrants who were a liability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said this Wednesday in an audience with Tambari Sanoussi, a Minister of State in Niger, who called on the president at the Castle, Osu, the official residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanoussi led his country's delegation to Tuesday's inauguration of President Rawlings and Vice-President John E. Atta Mills. Leaders of delegations from Benin, Guinea, Liberia and Togo, who attended the inauguration, also called on the Rwalings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Liberian refugees, who fled their country's civil war, Ghana is also saddled with economic refugees, mainly from neighbouring Sahelian countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said the best way to curb the influx of refugees from the sub- region into Ghana was for the governments of those countries to improve their economies and thus discourage their nationals from leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At another meeting, with Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan, Rawlings said that the sub-region was getting tired of its role in the war-torn country and might not go beyond the June time limit to withdraw peace- monitoring troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Abuja Peace Accord, the West African Peace Monitoring Group, or ECOMOG, will on Jan. 31, complete disarming Liberia's warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are scheduled for May and a President inaugurated in June to hopefully end the seven-year civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings said that West African countries contributing troops to ECOMOG had pumped so much money into Liberia that they were getting exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's gone on for far too long, and we cannot go beyond the schedule. We are coming to the end of our tether,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Thursday that he would travel to Washington D.C. on Jan. 23 to meet with United States President Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan told correspondents at the U.N. that he would use the meeting, the first between him and any head of state since he took office Jan. 1, to discuss U.S.-U.N. relations, particularly the settlement of Washington's 1.3 billion U.S. dollar debt to the world body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will also try and explain to them the need to work with other member states of the organization,&quot; Annan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the U.S. debt is added to those of other nations, the U.N. is owed 2.3 billion dollars. The U.S. pays a quarter of the U.N. yearly budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan will also meet with the chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Annan at the U.N. headquarters in New York and promised that President Clinton would make recommendations on the U.S. debt in the next U.S. budget.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses were testifying in Addis Ababa against 71 Derg members accused of genocide and crimes against humanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-five of the defendants are being tried in absentia. Among them is the former leader, Mengistu Haile Mariam, who fled Addis Ababa for exile in Harare, Zimbabwe, a few days before the collapse of his regime in May 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the witnesses spoke of the disappearances of close relatives who had been arrested at the height of the &quot;Red Terror&quot; campaign in Addis Ababa for anti-revolutionary activities. They were believed to have been executed, without trial, by the military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign was launched following an attempt to kill Mengistu in Addis Ababa in October 1976. He was then deputy chairman of the Derg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, 114 prosecution witnesses have testified. The trial resumes Jan 16.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The shootout between French troops and mutineers of the Central African Republic army, French President Jacques Chirac's call for intervention in eastern Zaire and the battle for privatization of Cote D'Ivoire's telecommunications service were the issues discussed in editorials in the African press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soleil commented on the reasons for the shooting to death of two French soldiers by the Mutineers in Bangui.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred, it said, because the mutineers were frustrated by the presence of French soldiers who frustrated the rebels' attempt to overthrow President Ange-Felix Patasse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that the former Malian military leader, Amadou Toumani Toure, was the leading peace negotiator between the mutineers and the government but wondered whether, under the circumstances, he would succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will the mutineers have the strength to overcome their resentment, after the shooting, and engage in dialogue?&quot; it asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa newspapers focused on the talks between Presidents Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, to find solution to the Banyamulenge revolt in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Kinshasa bi-weekly, La Societe, said that Moi, with backing of France and the United States, had tried to convince Mobutu to negotiate with the Banyamulenge leader, Laurent Kabila, and his allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan approach, it said, confirmed that Zaire's eastern neighbors, particularly Uganda and Rwanda, supported Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another bi-weekly, L' Avenir, wondered whether after Zaire's &quot;humiliating battle losses&quot; at the hand of the Banyamulenge, Kinshasa would negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Dakar newspaper, Sud Quotidien, noted that French President Jacques Chirac had called for an international force to end the rebellion. But, it noted, since the United States remained indifferent to this proposal, France was unable and would not try to intervene alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On economic matters, Ivorian newspapers commented on the plans to privatize the country's telecommunications sector. They also spoke of the battle between French and Malay interests for the Ivorian concern, CI-Telecom, which was the center of this privatization bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abidjan paper, Jour, said that the so-called privatization of CI- Telecom looked like &quot;a masquerade&quot; for selling it to France Telecom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this masquerade has been confirmed by the authorities, businessmen should draw conclusions,&quot; it said, and that would be that &quot;Cote D'Ivoire is well and truly the preserve of French business interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, Republicain Ivoirien said that the French could not possibly lose out because Paris &quot;considers Cote D'Ivoire as Africa's showcase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, it said, it wondered whether bidding had been fair since France already controlled the Ivorian energy and water utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overall, the (President Konan) Bedie government is the winner. With these gifts to France, it can expect to continue being the guarantor of French interest in Cote d'Ivoire,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Voie, another Abidjan paper, referred to an &quot;underground war&quot; between the U.S. and France (through Africa Bell and France Telecom), and said that the U.S. had been kept out of the deal to the advantage of the French.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - An outbreak of cholera has killed more than 100 people in the troubled Great Lakes region, currently teeming with refugees or displaced persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death toll was revealed here Thursday by the head of epidemiological services at the Brazzaville-based African regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Andre Ndikuyeze.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference to review the situation since fighting erupted in eastern Zaire last September, he said 8,000 cases of diarrhoea and 100 cases of cholera had been registered on the Rwanda-Zaire border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease killed five of the cases diagnosed, the WHO official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndikuyeze said that 100 deaths were recorded from 3,500 cases which were diagnosed among refugees who crossed from Zaire to Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cholera epidemic, he added, had killed 10 people in Burundi's Rumonge province. However, the epidemic had been controlled and the cholera- related mortality had also been reduced all over the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, WHO had to spend nearly three million U.S. dollars, which it received from various donors, to deal with all the emergency health and humanitarian needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndikuyeze said WHO will organize a meeting in Nairobi in February to prepare a contingent plan for emergency humanitarian intervention in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will be attended by countries neighbouring Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Sumner Dagogo-Jack, said Thursday that these polls would be preceded, on Feb. 24, by ward congresses to nominate candidates and select delegates for local council party congresses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only candidates of the five political parties approved by the military government of Gen. Sani Abacha will be involved in the council elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - GENERAL Jac Buchner, former police commissioner in the old KwaZulu homeland, has been implicated in running large supplies of war matG riel to Inkatha paramilitaries in the early 1990s by former members of the police special forces unit that operated out of the Vlakplaas base near Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence has been presented by former Vlakplaas agents to the truth commission. It indicates that Buchner was involved in supplying truckloads of weapons - assault rifles, rocket launchers, landmines, rockets and ammunition - to members of the Inkatha Freedom Party when he was the commissioner of police for the KwaZulu homeland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information is also in the possession of the Transvaal attorney general and is being investigated by his officials. This is the first time Buchner has been linked to the gun-running operation and it is likely he will feature, either as an accused or as a witness, in a huge trial that is expected to come before the courts early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock first exposed the clandestine gun- running operation during his murder trial when he named IFP senator Philip Powell, former homeland minister CJ Mtetwa and Transvaal Inkatha leaders Themba Koza and Humphrey Ndlovu as key middlemen in the weapons programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock also claimed at least four other police generals at the time - including Basie Smit, Krappies Engelbrecht, Nick van Rensburg and a General Steyn - were aware of the fact that Vlakplaas was ordered to supply a batch of home-made shotguns to Inkatha's paramilitary units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Vlakplaas commander never mentioned the name of the former KwaZulu police commissioner in his court testimony, probably because De Kock is known to have been fiercely loyal to Buchner since he fought with him during the Rhodesian bush war in the 1960s. De Kock was introduced to his wife in Rhodesia at the time by Buchner, and the two men have remained loyal friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also known that Buchner was a member of the Badger Unit, an association of police and military covert operatives set up by De Kock and his colleagues in the early 1990s. The Badger Unit has been implicated in various gun-running operations, including the project to supply Inkatha militias with weaponry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now other Vlakplaas officers - including De Kock's one-time confidant, Chappie Kloppers - have not only confirmed their commander's account of how Vlakplaas ferried weapons to Inkatha, but have also added the former homeland police commissioner's name to the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buchner was highly decorated during the Rhodesian bush war when he fought with South African police forces there. He then acquired a reputation in the security police during the 1970s - when he was in charge of &quot;debriefing&quot; captured guerillas - for his uncanny ability to use a combination of torture and psychological pressure to turn captured African National Congress cadres into police agents, or askaris. He was the mastermind of the police's askari units that worked with Vlakplaas to infiltrate and assassinate ANC-aligned activists in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was suspected Buchner used his office after he became police commissioner for KwaZulu to provide clandestine state support for the Zulu nationalist movement, but this is the first time strong evidence has emerged to show this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to contact Buchner for comment were not successful at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The last decades of Menilek's (1889-1913) reign marked the beginning of Ethiopia's modernisation, which had been delayed, among other reasons by almost a century of internal or external warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unprecedented period of peace after the battle of Adwa, the opening up of foreign contacts in the aftermath of the Italian defeat, and the advent of increasing numbers of foreign craftsmen, created an entirely new climate for economic and technological developent. This owed much also to the Emperor's almost child-like interest in innovations of all kinds, and to the ability of his trusted Swiss engineer Alfred Ilg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these factors contributed to the founding at this time of a modern state.  The Founding of Addis Ababa One of the earliest developments in the field of modernisation had its origin in 1881, when Menilek, then only king of Shawa, abandoned the old Shawan capital, Ankobar, and established his headquarters further south, on the mountain of Entoto. Later, in 1886, his consort Queen Taytu, and her courtiers, moved down to the nearby plain, the site of thermal waters. There they set up a new place of abode. Taytu named it Addis Ababa, literally New Flower. Five yeras later it became the capital of the Ethiopian realm, The settlement, which rapidly acquired the character of a boon town, had by 1910 an estimated population of around 70,000 permanent and 30,000 to 50,000 temporary inhabitants. The town became the site of many of the country's principal innovations, and, because of its sizeable population, enabled a degree of specialisation of labour scarcely known elsewhere in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter the Russians The growth of Addis Ababa, which was particularly rapid after the battle of Adwa, was accompanied by the construction of some of the country's earliest modern bridges. They were important in that the land in and around the capital was broken up by deep ravines, which were filled during the rainy season by unfordable torrents. One of the first Addis Ababa bridges was erected by a group of Russians after one of their number was drowned on the way to or from the then nearby Russian Legation. Other bridges were built over the Awash river on the trade route to the Gulf of Aden coast, and in Gojjam. Its local ruler, King Takla Haymanot, obtained the bridge- building services of an enterprising Italian, Count Salimbeni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where Tewodros had Failed Partly in view of the impending conflict with the Italians, Menilek subsequently reorganised the system of taxation. He instituted a tithe for the upkeep of the army, in 1892. This marked an important step, which Emperor Tewodros had attempted, but for lack of resources had failed to take, towards terminating the old, but iniquitous system, whereby the soldiers lived by looting from the peasantry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Money The need to assert Ethiopian sovereignty in the face of Italy's Protectorate claim may well also have helped to prompt Menilek to issue the country's first national currency in 1894. This, according to the Ethio- Italian Additional Convention of 1889 was to have been struck in Italy, but Menilek, after denuncing the Italo-Ethiopian Wechale treaty, of 1889, had it minted in Paris instead. The at least partially political motive for instituting the new currency was revealed in an official proclamation. It declared that this money was introduced &quot;in order that our country may increase in honour and our commerce prosper&quot;. The new money bore the then politically relevant Biblical motto: &quot;Ethiopia stretches forth her hands to God&quot;, as well as effigies of Menilek and the Lion of Judah. The currency was based on a silver dollar, of the same weight and value as the old Austrian Maria Theresa dollar, or thaler, which had circulated throughout Ethiopia, as well as much of the Middle East, since the mid-eighteenth century. Despite this equivalence Menilek's money failed to supplant the thaler, which for the next half century was to remain the country's principal coin. A mint was later established in the palace, with Austrian help. It was used to strike Menilek's smaller denomination coins, but not the thaler piece itself, which was imported from Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Postal Service The year 1894 also witnessed the issue of Ethiopia's first postage stamps. These too were produced in Paris, and bore representations of Menilek and the Lion of Judah. The stamps were at first little used in the country itself, but were well received by philatelists, and provided the basis for the subsequent development of an efficient postal system. This owed much to the assistance of French advisers, and enabled Ethiopia to join the International Postal Union in 1908. This was the first international organisation to which the country was admitted, but by no means the last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jibuti Railway Another important step taken by Menilek at this time was the granting to Ilg, in 1894, of a concession for the construction of Ethiopia's first railway, to link Addis Ababa with the French Somaliland port of Jibuti. Ilg, whose work confined him the Ethiopian capital, obtained the support of the French trader Lon Chefneux, who became his partner.  Implementation of the project could not, however, take place until after the battle of Adwa, on 1 March 1896, and the consequent elimination of Italy's Protectorate claim. The French Government almost immediately afterwards the gave permission, on 5 March, for the laying of an adjacent section of the line across French protectorate territory, between Jibuti port and the Ethiopian frontier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The railway project, however, soon ran into numerous technical, financial and political difficulties. Building operations were so delayed that the railway line reached Dire Dawa, half way between Addis Ababa and the coast, only in 1902. The original railway company then went bankrupt. Menilek was obliged to grant a second concession, in 1906, to his personal phycisian, Dr Vitalien, who had the support of the French Banque de l'Indo-Chine. Railway construction work, backed by French finance, was then resumed, and the line duly arrived at Aqaqi, in the vicinity of the capital, in 1915. The coming of the railway, the country's greatest technological achievement of the period, contributed greatly to the expansion, and permanence of Addis Ababa. Of major commercial importance, the line also led to substantial expansion of the country's import-export trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Railway construction was accompanied by the installation of the country's first telephone and telegraph line, which followed the railway track from the capital to the coast. This line, which was erected by the technicians working on the railway, and led from Addis Ababa to Jibuti. The line was supplemented, after the battle of Adwa, by a second one, installed by Italian electricians.  It ran from the Ethiopian capital to the frontier of Eritrea, as well as to a number of provincial capitals to the south and west of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Prostitution certainly has a number of negative effects both on the individuals and the society at large. Besides its contribution to moral degradation, it also greatly undermines the institution of family as marriages get broken apart as a result of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promiscuous sex relationship practiced by both the prostitutes and their customers also lead for the spread of a number of sexually transmitted diseases (STD's) pausing great threat to public health. This is particularly true especially in Ethiopia where a number of studies over the years conducted indicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High rate of HIV infection among prostitutes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role prostitutes play in perpetuating the AIDS pandemic has been studied by many investigators. Sex workers have been viewed as major reservoirs for a variety of sexually transmitted diseases in various parts of the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AIDS pandemic which few years ago was known to be a problem of western societies where deviant sexual behaviors are practiced, is now recognized from a number of sero-surveys conducted since 1984, it is also prevalent in Ethiopia. For instance, sero-epidemiological surveys carried out in 23 towns since 1988 indicated that the prevalence rate of HIV infection was 16.9 % among prostitutes, 13.0 % among long distance truck drivers, 3.7 % among blood donors, and 2.4 % among scholarship winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sero-survey conducted a year later among prostitutes and long distance truck drivers, this time in 8 towns (Adaitu, Asmara, Bahirdar, Diredawa, Metu, Nazareth, Nekemt, and Addis Ababa) has revealed that the prevalence rate in these towns increases by an average of over 60 % in year's time. Studies on STD's show that these too are also on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even among the general population, reported AIDS cases have been on the increase since 1986. This is reaching such a frightening proportion and Multi- partner sexual contact females or prostitutes play significant roles both as victims and transmitters of HIV in Ethiopia as studies done elsewhere show similar results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lack of use of protective methods:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Addis Ababa, HIV infection is on the increase which can be attributed to the large population of prostitutes in the city. In 1974, it was reported that some 80,000 prostitutes were in Addis Ababa constituting over 25 percent of the adult female population of the city. This figure has significantly increased over the years much to the great influx of women from rural areas.  Besides, most of the prostitutes never use protective methods regularly. For instance, a study conducted with 2663 prostitutes in Addis Ababa and 6564 prostitutes in 23 other towns of the country on pregnancy and STD protective means used by prostitutes indicated that outside the capital city, 42.2 % (n = 2771) of the women reported using oral contraceptives always or often and only 1.8 % of all women in the study always or often used condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results were similar in the capital city. This study in Addis Ababa which was carried out among four sub-groups of prostitutes: bar girls; tej (local wine) sellers, tella (local beer) sellers, and women in red-light houses, indicated that condoms and spermicide known to protect from sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and HIV infection were very rarely used by prostitutes in the city. Of all the respondents, only 1.8% used condoms often or regularly. The reason being that the popular STD's protective means among prostitutes in Addis Ababa are condoms which often depended on the choice of the customers. The overwhelming majority do not use condoms on regular basis because of the customer's refusal. One of the bar girls in Kasanchize state when asked about as to why she never use condoms regularly,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I prefer to use condoms and I ask the men to use them. Some say yes and others say no. If they use them well and good, but if they refuse I accept to sleep with without them. What can I do, I have no choice, I need the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study conducted among 282 randomly selected prostitutes in Addis Ababa indicate that among STD/pregnancy protective means widely used by women, oral pills are reported as the most widely used taken regularly by 41.7 % of the respondents, while intra-uterine device was negligible. The use of condoms are reported to be regular or frequent by 2.9 % of the females, occasional or very rare by 56 %. No use of condom are reported by 41.4 % of the respondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous studies in Ethiopia as in the rest of Africa have shown that prostitutes are at a higher risk of HIV infection and transmission- playing significant role in its spread. For instance, a sero-epidemiological survey on HIV infection carried out among four categories of prostitutes randomly selected in Addis Ababa that of the total 4975 females registered in 40 Kebeles (the smallest administrative unites); 2617 were interviewed and tested for HIV. The result indicated that a quarter of the female sex workers have been infected by HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major risk factors associated with HIV and other STD's infections and transmissions among prostitutes in Addis Ababa and else where in the country are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-high number of sexual partners,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-infection with other sexually transmitted diseases,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-lack of general education, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-duration of involvement in prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, the sero-epidemiological survey on HIV infection carried in Addis Ababa among the four categories of prostitutes indicated that the rate of infection for the entire group varied from 10.3% for those having one or less partner per week to 66.7% for those with 6-7 partners per week. Also according to this survey, the highest HIV prevalence rate was in the central zone of the city which includes Mercato, Arada and other business centers covering an area of 24.759 km. The prostitute population is concentrated in this central zone which also has a high density of population of the city.  This indicates that prostitutes are at a higher risk of HIV infection and transmission in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the on going discussions, one can clearly see the effect prostitution has both on the individuals and the country at large. As in the case of Addis Ababa and other urban areas of Ethiopia where the use of protective means aimed at both safer sex and contraception is rather very low in spite of the frequent sexual practice and turn over of partners reported by multi partner sexual contact women, prostitution acts as a major vehicle for the spread of STD's including HIV. Needless to say that most of the clients are Ethiopian citizens with the exception of few foreigners mainly claiming the economically active age group of the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous studies on prostitution show that the age group between 15-24 years is the most frequently infected. For instance, according to the one sero-epidemiological survey on HIV infection among randomly selected prostitutes in Addis Ababa indicated that HIV prevalence rates was highest among the age groups between 15-24 and 25-34 years respectively. This is also true among the general population of the reported AIDS cases, it is highest among the age groups between 20-29, 30-39 and 40-49 respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIDS cases as of 30 November, 1994. Total 15565. Source: Adapted from AIDS update, epidemiology &amp; AIDS control department, Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia in 1993 with great openness admitted having close to half a million AIDS patients. This figure is increasing greatly as the human immune deficiency virus epidemic is showing a tremendous progress. Again prostitutes are the most important reservoir of many sexually transmittable pathogens including HIV in Ethiopia and other developing countries. The 1993 World Bank report presented at a symposium on AIDS and development held by the Abidjan based African Development Bank (ADB) said, that the disease was cutting down millions of Africans in the prime of life draining family purses and state health budgets and depressing industrial and agricultural out put; making the world's poorest continent even poorer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the World Bank report said that it was impossible to estimate accurately how far AIDS was hitting national income, but it was probably cutting the rate of growth of gross domestic product per capita. The problem is even made more serious, because many African countries are trying to recover from falling per capita incomes in the 1980's. World Bank foretells that the AIDS epidemic will continue to make recovery more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AIDS epidemic is doing more economic damages than any common diseases such as malaria because it strikes mainly at the economically-active population both rich and poor. Today, in many African countries as is the case in Ethiopia, particularly in urban areas, AIDS has doubled or tripled the adult death rate becoming the biggest adult killer. For instance, the World Bank report quoted a 1988 study showing that 25 days of inpatient AIDS treatment at Zaire's biggest hospital, Mama Yemo, cost 90 dollars, three times the average monthly income. Businesses are suffering from the loss of workers and absenteeism due to AIDS-related illness. The report also said that up to 10 percent of the Uganda railway corporation's 5,600 employees have died of AIDS over the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ethiopia, the AIDS toll is claiming a considerable labor force both in the rural and urban parts of the country. How can we strive hard to rebuild and develop this country when AIDS is dealing a major blow to the struggle for economic recovery and development? And if it risks reversing all of the efforts, all of the hard-won achievements of the past few years that the government so passionately boast's of?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is prostitution a national problem yet or do we have to sit and wait until it starts knocking at every door and further break apart the family system and destroy our ailing economy? Do we have means and can we effectively exploit them to contain its spread? Thus the harmful effects of prostitution are very serious indeed and something Tshould be done to contain its spread.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In January 1996, the maximum import tariff rate was cut from 80 percent to 60 percent as a result of which the average customs rate declined from 29.5 percent to 24.5 percent. (It has been reported that the rate is now down to 50 percent ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be interesting to note that the maximum customs duty was as high as 209 percent as recently as 1993. However, government revenue from import duties increased substantially from some 700 million birr in 1992/93 to over 1.6 billion birr in 1995/96. This was partly due to the devaluation of the birr which inflated the nominal import tax base in birr terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, the decline in the weighted average customs rate, which was not as high as that in the maximum rate, is more important in determining the outcome on government revenue that the cut in the maximum rate per se, which affects only a relatively few luxury items. While imports of especially items considered luxury would have been unaffordably expansive for most people without the progressive customs tariff reduction, the rate reduction on the other hand seems to have exposed domestic import-substituting industries to rather stiff import competition, particularly in the textiles and food sectors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1996, domestic fertilizer prices were reduced from an average of 245 birr per quintal to 195 birr per quintal. Although the measure afforded some relief to peasant farmers across the country, it is believed to have inflated the government's expenditure on subsidies. Since even at this subsidized average price, fertilizer is still expensive vis a vis average farm incomes, it is doubtful whether the peasant's perception of the high costs of farm inputs has changed in any significant way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1996, the controversial measure of banning franco valuta imports was taken by the government (franco valuta imports required no foreign exchange from the domestic banking system). Arguments for and against the measure have been entertained both in the government-owned mass media and in the private press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the effects of the ban, three major questions may be raised: has the flow of imports been affected? Have domestic prices of imports gone up as a result of the narrowing of the scope for importation to only licensed importers? Has anything been lost in terms of efficiency in the import mechanism? It is difficult to ascertain the facts related to these queries on a nation-wide basis, but indications so far are that some imports (for example, used cars) are not as readily available as before and this has tended to raise domestic prices. For instance, the prices of second-hand cars have tended upward in recent months. In terms of efficiently, it a well-known fact that the franco valuta system was at least twice more efficiency than the letter-of-credit(L/C) mechanism in terms of time cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in July 1996, four measures related to foreign exchange operations were announced to have become effective. These were a) the formal institution of export retention schemes, b) the establishment of foreign exchange bureaus within commercial banks, c) the change from fortnightly to weekly foreign exchange auctions, and d) the lifting of the ban on foreign exchange access for imports of used goods with the exception of clothing. Ten percent of export earnings may now be retained in exporters' own retention accounts. The scheme has generally been received favorably by exporters. Foreign exchange bureaus have still not started actual operation at the time of writing, but when they do they are expected to at least help in decentralizing the exchange control operations of the National Bank of Ethiopia. On the other hand, the fact that foreign exchange auctions are now held every week instead of every fifteen days has improved the availability of foreign exchange. The removal of the ban on foreign exchange bidding for imports of used goods has lessened the negative impact of the abolition of the franco valuta mechanism through which such imports were allowed. Even then, the still-in-effect ban on used clothing, which now accounts for a very significant part of the purchases of clothes by the vast majority of consumers, has continued to exert its negative consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in August 1996 that the Administration of Region 14 put into effect its unconscionable rent increases on government -owned houses used for commercial purposes. The reverberations of this drastic measure are far from dead, and its effects have in many cases become unbearably burdensome.  Attempts at passing at least part of the extra costs on to consumers have so far been timid and modest at best. There is hardly any doubt that the measure has caused an enormous amount of financial distress in the business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, there was a bit of cheerful news in September 1996 (effective as of September 11, to be exact) when increases of no mean relative magnitude were announced in favour of low-income pensioners. The raises are by no means anywhere near the equivalent of an offset to years of cumulated inflation, but the gesture towards this nearly forgotten section of our society never failed to gladden many a heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But soon afterwards the bad news was upon once again. On 22 September 1996, fuel price increases were announced by the government, true to official commitments entered into with the IMF and World Bank. Strangely, there have been no offsetting increases in day-time taxi fares in Addis Ababa, for example. Sheer low purchasing power of the public and quite possibly fear of government retaliation appear to have been the reason behind tax operators' obvious error on the side of mercy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in September there was another piece of news of significant economic import. The National Bank of Ethiopia, never a laggard in policy innovation, announced drastic cuts in interest rates. The minimum interest rate on bank deposits was slashed from 10 to 7 percent while the maximum lending rate was chopped from 15 to 10.5 percent. The news was received with mixed feelings.  Some thought the lowering of the lending rate was a relief while some bit their lips with obvious displeasure as they quickly reckoned the prospect of dwindling interest income on their deposits. Further, the implicit narrowing down of the margin between the deposit and lending rates was not exactly the best of news for commercial banks, some of which have still not managed to get rid of their long faces on the decisions!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1996, the proclamation (Proc. No. 40/1996) on so-called micro- financing institutions (or really mini-banks) was issued. The idea did initially succeed in creating some excitement among a few prospective financial investors, but it appears the enthusiasm has since evaporated as not a single new financial investor has been licensed to date on the basis of the proclamation. it is believed that some of the conditions laid down in the proclamation are not particularly attractive, which means revisions may be called for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mid-September witnessed a historic economic event and decision. The consultative Group Meeting for Ethiopia was held here in Addis Ababa, the first time ever the meeting took place not only in Ethiopia but also on African soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome of the deliberations of the meeting was an unmitigated success for the ERPDF government, producing a pledge of 2.5 billion US dollars in outright grants and concessional loans from participating donor governments and international organizations, when in fact the amount requested by the Ethiopian government was only 2 billion US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Christmas holiday mood may have been a factor in the generous extra gesture, but the whole outcome must have taken the government by surprise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Medical care in Ethiopia has been going down hill for the past eight years, according to Dr. Pawlos Quana'a. At 62, Dr. Pawlos Quana'a, an Ophthalmic Surgeon, is as opinionated and headstrong as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His recent retirement as head of the Eye Department at the Addis Ababa University far from spells out an end to one of the most illustrious medical careers in the country. He will try to re-activate his private clinic which has been sealed by the region 14 health bureau for the past year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By his calculation, he is most probably one of the first ten Ethiopian doctor to graduate and return to this country. &quot;Some stupid fellow &quot; in Wingate -- where Dr. Pawlos went to school -- told the class that the World Health Organization was giving out scholarships and those who wanted to be doctors should put up their hands. &quot;We did not know what being a doctor meant&quot; he explained but the whole class followed the hand of one classmate, he said.  That &quot;stupid fellow&quot; may not have been so stupid after all, for some of the best doctors of the country came from that class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scholarship was for the American University of Beirut, where his London Matriculation results enabled him to go straight to the second year. Though there was a somewhat large Ethiopian community in Beirut--with four fifths of the country's senior medical staff graduating from there--the new culture took some getting used to, remembers Dr. Pawlos. When a teacher entered the class the Ethiopian students who, out of habit stood, could not help noticing the others lounging in their desks. The climate was another bone of contention. When the Ethiopians complained about the heat and humidity, the people around were quick to respond, &quot;How did you get to be so dark then?&quot;.  But it was not all discomfort and misunderstandings. They took part in special cultural shows and also had fun on the sports field. Dr. Pawlos still proudly remembers coming first in the 800 meters and taking part in soccer and the pole vault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1958, he graduated and came back to Ethiopia to work at what was then known as the Princess Tsehai Memorial Hospital. Though the government was doing all it can to get more Ethiopian doctors, it was more than obvious that it still had a long way to go before it achieved its goal. &quot;It was unbelievable&quot; Dr. Pawlos exclaimed as he recalled that there were around five hundred foreign doctors here in Addis Ababa alone. &quot;When it was the king's birthday the Ministry of Health would hold a cocktail, where we would be invited. we would stand by the wall with our coke in our hands&quot; he added, &quot; because the foreigners would have filled the room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patients, used to the mostly Bulgarian and Yugoslav Doctors, could not come to terms with their Ethiopian counterparts. &quot;The patients would always complain,&quot; said Dr. Pawlos, &quot;that the doctor had not seen them. When we went to them and said 'but I saw you this morning', they would reply 'I do not mean you, I meant the foreigner.' Of course rather capable people help change this attitude, now, it is an entirely different story. &quot;Of the expatriate doctors, Dr. Pawlos said, &quot;there were some good one, and of course there were some terrible ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily, there was a General Medical Advisory Board (GMAB) that screened anybody who was not capable.&quot; In trying to illustrate clearly just how useful the GMAB was, he tells of an instance where someone with a B.A. in Education was caught in Arussi trying to pass himself for a doctor. &quot;The nurses were complaining that the man, who came from Sudan, did not seem to be a doctor.  So we went to check him out and true enough he did not know the slightest thing.&quot; Two years later, Dr. Pawlos went back to Lebanon to specialize in Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat (EENT), but found out he could only do one--so he chose the eye. When he came back to Ethiopia this time, he joined Menelik Hospital eye department. In 1970 he became head of the eye department at the Addis Ababa University. &quot;Luckily,&quot; he explained, &quot;eye doctors from the ministry of health would help out. But for many years, I could claim I was the only one in the university who had only one staff in his departmen.&quot; The one-man department soon expanded in 1983, when three of the first batch of eye doctors joined the department. It still remains understaffed, but Dr. Pawlos is hopeful that this might change soon. The department has now graduated around thirty-two eye doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from his duties at the university and Menelik Hospital, Dr. Pawlos is involved in various activities. He is the chairman of the National PolioPlus Committee, and the district coordinator of Janipur Foot for Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Eritrea. Both selfless Rotary activities, he notes. He was also the outgoing president for the Ophthalmic Society of Ethiopia in 1996, and past president of Rotary Club of Addis Ababa. Till 1994, he was International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVAGC) regional representative for Africa. Dr.  Pawlos is also country representative for the Afro Arab Society of Ophthalmology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia started training its own doctors in 1963, and medical care in the country was rising steadily. That is until recently. According to Dr. Pawlos, Ethiopia does not lack manpower, yet. Discouraged with the state of things, the country's young doctors are leaving for other countries. &quot;Saudi Arabia has no manpower but it does have enough cash&quot; Dr. Pawlos noted to hire expatriated--some of them Ethiopians. Ethiopia on the other hand, he said, had the manpower but artificial scarcity of medical supplies by the health authorities, he said, were making things bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long waiting lists, inadequate service, lack of essential equipment as gloves and syringes, are a clear indication that what had started out full of promise four decades ago, looks highly disheartening now. Dr. Pawlos Quana'a, a bachelor, has one daughter from his previous marriage. His hobbies include swimming, and reading historical and classical novels. Surprising for someone whose year book shows inscribed under his photo, 'resistance to tyranny is obedience to God' and 'Stubbornness is a virtue not a vice,' Dr. Pawlos' motto in life is 'Fair play'.</SPAN></P>

NSC is highly structured and it has the support of the Ethiopian Government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also a strong regional support. All this is positive.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 26 Somali leaders who have taken the initiative to bring peace and stability for Somalia and also to the Horn need to be supported. For the sake of the Somali people and for the sake of peace and stability in the Horn of Africa, we hope Mr. Hussien Aideed will join the coalition. The people of Somalia genuinely need peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - AKPAC, the firm publishing Tobia, independent Amharic weekly newspaper and monthly magazine, announced yesterday that it will suspend publication of its weekly paper indefinitely in protest against the arrest of four of its top editors. The monthly Tobia magazine, however, will continue to come out every month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth arrest occurred Monday afternoon, when the editor-in-chief for the last four issues of the newspaper, Ato Arega Woldekirkos was taken from his office and placed in the Central Investigation Prison . According to Tobia sources, the charges against Ato Arega are not yet known, but he might appear in court today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Arega took over the post of Editor-In-Chief from Ato Goshu Moges, when the latter was arrested on 12 December, in connection with an article on the November 23 hijacking of Ethiopian flight 961. Ato Goshu, acting manager of AKPAC, was filling in for Ato Taye Belachew and Ato Anteneh Merid, editor-in- chief, and deputy editor-in-chief of Tobia, who had been arrested on 22 and 25 November respectively. The two have been in prison for 49 and 46 days in prison, without having their cases heard in court, noted Tobia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AKPAC has explained that it was ceasing publication of Tobia weekly newspaper not because of manpower or financial constraints, but because it did not want to continue putting forward more people as 'sacrifice'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area around Estifanos Church (near ECA/ Mesqel Square) was filled with the sounds of screaming and havoc as shooting was heard coming from within the Church premises, around eleven yesterday morning. According to eye- witness accounts, Bahitawi G/Selassie, a monk, was killed, while another monk is reported to have been slightly injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monk was shot as he was trying to give a petition to the Patriarch, said BBC. On the question of who shot the monk, the BBC correspondent here in Addis Ababa said &quot;It is the belief of the people whom I contacted that somebody from the Patriarch's group is responsible for that&quot;. It was also indicated that a serious rift was been seen within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church for the first time. The Petition in question, BBC noted most probably has to do with the election of the Patriarch and the teachings within the church.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Ethiopian radio reported that a man with a big sward had tried to disturb the peace, and was consequently shot by an individual. The police have the gunman in custody, the government radio reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses on the scene stated that police soon arrived on the scene and tried to persuade a reluctant crowd to disperse. The office of the private secretary of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church has confirmed that Patriarch Paolos--who was giving a sermon there that day--was unhurt. They declined, however, to give further comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers said they saw what they believe to be two Greek Orthodox priests leaving the church through a side entrance and driving off. However, Mr.  Constantinos Marros, Attach&lt;130&gt; to the Greek Embassy here in Ethiopia, stated that both priests were nowhere near the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we go to print, nothing is yet known about what set off the incident, the identity of the gunman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - When a person decides to go into business, it means he or she is going to devote a lot of time, in fact nearly all of his or her working hours, to thinking about how to create value in order to make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among very many other things, a business person in Ethiopia would have to study the general business climate in the country, the size of the domestic market, areas of business where there are noticeable shortages and where there would be demand if goods and services presently unavailable could be supplied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A certain moderately rich Ethiopian businessman once asked an Ethiopian economist who was trying to expound theories about how wealth was crated: &quot;If you think you're so smart at making money, why aren't you a millionaire?&quot; The quick answer from the economist was: &quot;I haven't been thinking about making money for myself. Instead, I have been drawing development plans for the government&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point made here is fairly clear: if you want to be rich, then you've got to spend most of your waking hours (and some of your dreaming hours) on how to create wealth and make money for yourself. A business person should also get rid of the dated stereotype which depicts money as filthy, as being the &quot;root of all evil&quot; and suchlike. Further, although it may hold true in many isolated cases, the saying &quot;behind every fortune there is crime&quot; would be in stark contradiction with the stupendous amount of individual wealth crated through hard work and innovation. After all, crime does not crate any wealth. It merely forcibly or fraudulently transfers wealth from the one party to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, the first order of business in business would be to be ready to think a great deal about ways and means of making money, to think of money not as filthy, but as an embodiment of value created through sheer hard work and innovative skill and talent; and to visualize money as an expression of individual merit and worth. Try to follow this thought process in the mind of a certain businessman and evaluate the worth of mental input into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make 10,000 birr in one month here in Addis Ababa. I can't buy shares and sell them at a profit, because there is no share market in Ethiopia. What about buying a second-hand car from somebody who needs cash immediately and is willing to sell the car at a bargain price and then reselling it at a good profit? But where would I get the information to meet such a person? I can try the local brokers, but if they do know of such a person they would have sold the information long ago! O.K., that may not work.  I am a civil engineer by training and can do the engineering section of the feasibility study of any physical project. I will go to my friend at the Development Bank of Ethiopia and ask him if he knows of any bank client who wants a feasibility study done in a month's time so that the client may be eligible for a project loan from the bank. Well, if he does know of such a client, he would probably want to do the feasibility study himself in his spare time and make money for himself rather than pass it on to a friend. I will phone him anyway. 'Hello, Solomon! How are you doing these days? Are you making money or making trouble? I know the only other thing you make besides money is love! Not a bad philosophy, that! Now, coming to the purpose of my phone call, Solomon, would you do me a favor? Have you got an extra feasibility study project in which I can participate? Oh, yes? How much is the fee for the engineering section? 8000 birr? Not bad. I will take it. I should be able to make another 2000 birr during breaks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is quite a lot of thinking time devoted to making money. The guy may then go home, dust off his book on project analysis and start writing on topics such as the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Preliminary tests and studies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Properties of raw materials to be used</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* hardness of water</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* soil characteristics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* atmospheric conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Location</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* availability of raw materials</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* power and water supply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* transport facilities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Production technology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Equipment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Effluent disposal system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Layout of site, building and plant, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This particular person would be making money doing something professional, but he or she is doing business all the same. A means of making money is thought out, an opportunity is explored and exploited and real value is being created in return for which money is to be earned. That essentially is the basic scheme for making money. It is legal, acceptable and personally gratifying. There is no corruption and no crime in it. A businessman proper might do it differently. He could use his seed capital to put up a consultancy firm, hire professionals at good salaries, win project study contracts and have them studied in his consultancy enterprise for a profit.  That too is good business and good money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all this the role of the government would be to facilitate things for businesspeople, to register their prospective businesses and grant them licenses, to make basic infrastructure such as water and electricity available, to clear their goods through customs in the fastest time possible, to guarantee legal security for their property and so on. But is this what is being done in Ethiopia at present? Suppose you want to make perhaps the safest of all investments in Ethiopia, namely building a house on a piece of land and renting it out. Try to follow below what you may encounter in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first office of the sclerotic government bureaucracy you would perhaps have to go to would be the Ethiopian Investment Office (EIO). Here you may not face very many problems provided you present the necessary documents. So we can assume that you will get your investment license (in the real estate sector) reasonably quickly. But your investment license would soon prove to be no more than a piece of paper with some ineffective seal of authority on it. You will find that out at the Municipality of Addis Ababa where, upon you request for, say, 500 square meters of land, everybody would consider you as somebody who has gone delirious with fantasy born of extreme deprivation, as they know it to be the case with very many people in Addis ! Repeat the request, if you like, but nobody would even so much as look up to talk to you! For all they know, you might be an alien from Mars!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In despair, you would turn back and walk away. On your way out, the guard at the gate may tell you, instinctively stretching his hands to frisk you, which is usually not necessary on the way out, &quot;if you are trying to buy land, it is simple. Find someone who has spare land to sell on his premises. All he has to do is just put up a small shelter on it and say he is selling the 'house', not the land&quot;. You are likely to answer: &quot;I have tried that, but I don't want to pay the price they are asking. 90,000 birr for 200 square meters with a coop on it!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, take it or leave it. That in fact is the kind of land price individual occupant are asking. They may not even have title deeds on the 'house'! And the location may be nearly 15 kilometers away from downtown. All this because the government is sticking to its state-monoploy-on-land policy like a leech! So, all the government-owned mass media are saying about there being a one-stop investment programme in Ethiopia is true after all! The trouble is that your only stop is at the EIO where you are issued with a virtually worthless piece of paper they call &quot;investment certificate.&quot; Progress from there is like climbing Ras Dashen with a quintal-heavy load on your back! How about that, now?! With your hopes of becoming a landlord thus dashed, you may, if you are a person with the energy level required of a true businessman, try to think up other areas of business where you can make money such as the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* buying and selling used cars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* putting up a pawn shop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* establishing a funeral serves firm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* what about public shower rooms and latrines; these could be lucrative!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* parking lots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* car wash and greasing service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ready-made clothes, reasonably priced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a high-standard private school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* growing exportable agricultural products</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a public resort with swimming pools</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* putting up a gymnasium</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* good-quality but reasonably priced food, aiming at turnover rather than high prices</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* establishing a marriage brokerage firm. Don't wince at the idea, because you could make a lot of money on it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* an all-purpose repair service shop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a soccer ticket sales agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a fund raising association for St. George Soccer Club operating on commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a modern domestic servants brokerage firm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* putting up a medium-size cinema house to show all the latest films in America and Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a condom wholesale distribution center</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* establishing a mini-bank on the basis of NBE's recent proclamation on micro-financing, provided some changes could be made in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But you almost forgot! Not a single business activity listed above can be established without land! How defining the government policy on land is could be readily appreciated from this. You just can't possibly talk about business, money-making, value-creation and economic development in Ethiopia without first talking about how the government's land policy should be revised, and quickly! and then, of course there is the ossified government bureaucracy!  But that is another behemoth of a problem! What to do? As pointed out above, a businessperson with the right energy level never quits. If he or she can't do the physical things such as those mentioned above, he or she can try to make money talking about all these development problems. So. why not try to get a contract from an international NGO or some other external funding source to organize symposium, seminars, workshops, bull sessions, and suchlike on topics such as the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Is the government's land policy realistic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* What to do with nationalized properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* How to modernize and increase the efficiently of:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the customs authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the inland revenue service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* EELPA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the water and sewerage authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the Municipality of Addis Ababa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the maritime service authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the telecommunications authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* courts in Ethiopia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* complaints about customer service at state-owned and private banks and how to handle them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The dangers posed by politically affiliated semi-monopolies to free competition and what to do about them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* How to start a small-scale business when the land policy is revised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* How to persuade the government to substantially reduce the recently increased house rents: lessons in negotiating skills and power of persuasion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you can't find a conference hall for a fee to organize these workshops and symposiums, don't give up hope. Just lie down somewhere and try to think up something else to do that will make money. Honestly earned money is an embodiment of personal merit and worth!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - Quiet Benoni boy Philip Holiday has suddenly emerged as one of the heavy hitters - financially speaking - among the lightweights of world boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He raised the stakes in his division with his emphatic points win over his previously unbeaten and highly regarded mandatory challenger, Ivan Robinson, at Sol Kerzner's Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, on December 21. Over the past three weeks phones, faxes and e-mail modems have been kept warm with offers and counter-offers for his services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after his victory, Holiday stressed to me that the fight he wanted was a unification with the unbeaten World Boxing Association (WBA) champion Orzabek Nazarov - who twice whipped Dingaan Thobela. &quot;He's the best of the other champions, is also unbeaten and looks like remaining that way, so he's the one to fight. We'll examine his style, find his weaknesses and work out how to beat him,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To which his manager-trainer, Harold Volbrecht, added: &quot;I know Nazarov is good, but I honestly believe, after watching him several times, that Philip is better. He's the best lightweight in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holiday's promoters, Cedric Kushner (United States) and Rodney Berman (South Africa) say they will do their best to persuade the Home Box Office (HBO) network, which now has Holiday under contract, to put up the money for the fight immediately. Though the more likely scenario is that both fighters will be &quot;built up&quot; with a few more defences in the US, before meeting in a lightweight showdown. The third major champion, Jean- Baptiste Mendy of France, is regarded as the weakest and is controlled by Don King, which would make a unification more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite knockout victories over the previously unbeaten Columbian power merchant Miguel Julio, to take the title, and Australia's three-time world champion Jeff Fenech, and an unbeaten record (now 30:0 - 16), Holiday was still a largely unknown commodity internationally, and certainly an underrated one at home, until he faced Robinson live on HBO and in front of a 2 000-strong capacity casino crowd which included modern &quot;legends&quot; like Marvin Hagler and Roy Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was up against a significantly bigger, faster, slicker, 23:0 Philadelphian who was one of the young stars of the US circuit and a 5:4 betting favourite to lift the International Boxing Federation (IBF) title.  but throughout his intense US preparations, Holiday seemed completely unfazed by the ordeal facing him. When I interviewed him in his hotel bedroom the night before the fight, he was his usual relaxed, quiet, courteous self and showed no hint of doubt that he would prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result, as usual, was an extremely confident performance by the 26-year- old which delighted the moguls of the HBO cable network who had taken a significant gamble in screening the fight live in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lou DiBella, the HBO senior vice-president responsible for its boxing programme, said he did this because he had heard good things about Holiday. &quot; I'm told he is the sleeper at 62kg so I'm eager to see him. Bob Yalen of ABC and ESPN was telling me that he thinks Holiday may be one of the most underrated fighters in the world today.&quot; And he expressed himself well- pleased with what he witnessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reaction certainly impressed the directors of the Mohegan Sun - a massive new gambling complex set on a Native American reservation (and periodically checked by radiation inspectors because of its former status as a nuclear manufacturing site). The result is that Holiday fights are virtually guaranteed the kind of site fees that only the major casinos can provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holiday surprised the crowd, and pleased the viewers, with a mercurial performance which saw him throwing an unprecedented volume of punches over 12 intense rounds. The result showed a wide victory, but this does not reflect the tone of the battle, because many of the rounds were extremely close.  After a clean fight, with very few clinches, the judges gave it to Holiday by eight, seven and four points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the faster-moving challenger more than held his own over the first seven rounds, employing an accurate jab and some spectacular combinations, Holiday gradually wore him down with his persistent body attack and then cruised through the last five rounds, winning all of them. In the end, Holiday's greater work rate saw him through. According to the CompuBox statistics, Holiday threw 1 493 punches, connecting with 555. Of these, 1 116 were classed as &quot;power punches&quot; with 467 landing. Robinson threw 1 093 punches, connecting with 440 and 761 were classed as power punches, with 338 landing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My game plan is always to go to the body and slow the guys down and then I can do what I want,&quot; he told me later. &quot;He slowed down in the later rounds, but I must admit, he slowed later than I thought he would. I must take my hat off to him. There are not many guys who have been conditioned like Robinson.  He really fought a good fight. I thought I caught him with some good shots, though I don't think I followed up quick enough. A pace like this takes it out of you, but I'm extremely happy with this performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What impresses me most about Holiday is his combination of modesty and absolute self- assuredness. Part of this undoubtedly comes from his fundamentalist Christian faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been given a talent and I honestly believe that if the Lord wants me to box, and he has given me this talent, I must box.&quot; he said when I interviewed him afterwards. &quot;I'm here because I've got to be a shining light for Him. That's why I've won the world title. It's not because I'm suddenly so great. I've got to give the glory to the Lord because he's given me the world title.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He grew up in a close, comfortable, sporty, devoutly Christian family in Benoni, the youngest of eight children (five brothers and one sister). He did reasonably well at school, seldom got into trouble and avoided street fights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At high school I had one or two people who tried to cause trouble, but I think I had only one fight in school, but I was a very quiet person. My sister actually used to call me a nerd. So I wasn't very violent and I just used to keep to myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Robinson fight, Holiday was accompanied by a large family delegation, including his non-identical-twin brother, Paul, and his fiancee, Bree, but it is clearly his mother, Joyce, who is the backbone of the clan and the strongest influence on Holiday's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told me that after her son completed his military service and his draughtsman's training, she prayed for days about his desire to box professionally and was finally given an affirmative answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;Blourokkie&quot; pentecostal, before each fight she makes a point of reassuring her son's perenially nervous promoter, Rodney Berman, that Holiday will win because God has told her so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Holiday's confidence is also due to his phenomenal physical conditioning and clean living. Certainly there can be few boxers in the world who can match him in the stamina department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to his twice-a-day, six-times- a-week boxing training, he is a keen amateur cyclist, canoeist and marathon runner, and participates occasionally in biathlons and triathlons as well. &quot;I do the triathlons and the cycle races for fun, for enjoyment, but at the same time I do it to help me with the boxing. It's really fantastic for stamina. It's great for the cardiovascular system and general fitness, and the cycling works a lot on the legs, so when you get to the eighth, 10th round and your legs start to get tired, that's where the cycling helps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional dimension to his sense of purpose is his steady improvement as a fighter, particularly in defence. When I watched him in his amateur days (when he was twice South African champion and won his Springbok colours, as well as in his early professional days, he used to take two to land one and rely on his hard jaw, but like Brian Mitchell, he learnt to slip, block, duck and parry his way in without absorbing an excess of leather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After I turned professional, Harold always used to say to me, 'You're early in the boxing game - you've got a lot to learn'. You can't suddenly be the best bob-and- weaver in the country, and be able to slip and counter, so we were happy with my progress, even though some people complained I was taking too many punches. I've always worked with my defence, and even today I'm trying to improve it further, because I don't want to be one of those guys in 10, 15 years' time you can hardly have a conversation with. It's been a big aim of mine to be a more defensive boxer and I think you can see the results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holiday says he never consciously modelled his style on Mitchell's, but that he absorbed a great deal from the former IBF and WBA junior lightweight champion through sparring thousands of rounds with him. &quot;Through training with him all the time, I could only learn from that and pick up different moves from him. He was a fantastic boxer and I was wanting to learn as much as I could, so anything he did I would try in the gym and that's how it came into my style.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holiday is small for his division, no great stylist and does not have the one-punch knockout power of a Jan Bergman, but his assets are nevertheless impressive. He maintains a phenomenal workrate and also has great natural strength, a solid chin, a tight bob-and-weave defence, one of the best body attacks in the game and an indomitable will to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His ultimate ambition is &quot;to retire undefeated and undisputed lightweight champion of the world&quot;. Though the likes of Nazarov and America's Shane Mosely (who whipped Oscar de la Hoya in his amateur days) represent threats to his claim to be number one, he is a fighter who will not easily be beaten - as five title challengers have already discovered. There is no doubt that he is right up there with Vuyani Bungu and Mbulelo Botile as one of South Africa's three best boxers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he &quot;doesn't have a clue&quot; how much longer he will stay in the game, but is refreshingly realistic about the subject. &quot;I like to take one fight at a time. I've got my goals in the back of my mind and if those things don't work out and I start taking too much punishment, start getting some losses, I will have to start thinking about retiring and giving it up. Today I might say to you I want another 10 fights, and tomorrow I get beaten up badly and then think it's time to give up, and then I might say I want another two fights, and then things go very well, and then I'll think, 'why should I give up?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - THE last fortnight has shown that perhaps the greatest thing about this wonderful game of cricket is that it constantly redefines the parameters that ordinarily constrain the edges of sporting excellence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How else would you define the magic of Sachin Tendulkar denying the restrictions of his individual altitude above the turf to turn in an innings of such cricketing class in the first innings of a second test when, facing the monolith of a 500-plus total to chase on a Newlands wicket, the ko'l, as the old Afrikaans saying goes, was already a long time deur die kerk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, for that matter, the imperious manner in which Mohammad Azharuddin dismantled the fearsome South African seam attack in an innings that is among the finest ever played at Newlands? Azhar has the wristy disdain for the good of all that has ever been the stamp of India's great batsmen, and the little master Sunil Gavaskar - by any measure a cricketing great - must have taken heart from his position in the commentary box that the legacy he left behind will live on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Tendulkar at the other end, the 222 partnership produced a brief moment of all that is glorious about the great old game. Interestingly, it will probably be this collision of cricketing genius, after half the side had been sent packing for a miserly 58 runs, that will live in the minds longer than the actual result.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, for many, probably overshadow the sheer guts and graft of Gary Kirsten's century after his disappointments of 2x2 in the Kingsmead test, as well as the control of Brian Macmillan in forging a three- figure total that underlined his mastery of the craft. Macmillan's century was - as his Man of the Match award at Newlands rightly testifies to - the pivot on which the series finally swung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big man came good when he had to. Like Andrew Hudson - a touch off form but still prepared to guts it out for two match- winning half centuries at Kingsmead - and his opening partner Kirsten, the business of batting it out against the class seam bowling of Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad became a contrasting study in equal measures of determination and derring-do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then there was the Lance Klusener century, an innings that owed more to the young man's inherent and refreshing belief that the ball is there to be disposed of than it did to the structured tenets of WG Grace's legacy of playing each delivery on its merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply unforgettable. Klusener has fully justified in just three tests the decision of the national selectors. The pugnacious Klusener, who, while he spots young Adam Bacher some three years and Paul Adams nearly five on the calendar, is equally a tyro to the test arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in two brief spells of magic he has become the best debutant bowler for this country with his second innings 8/64 in Calcutta and the fastest centurion South Africa has produced with his 102 off just 100 balls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a spell of play that removed the dourness that can so often typify test cricket, and made the whole thing fun again. But such are the vagaries of a game that defies logic, that the wheel had to turn ... as it duly did when Klusener took the ball to attack Tendulkar and Azharuddin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, you have to admire Klusener's cricketing make-up. This was never more evident than when Azharuddin took him for four fours in the opening over after lunch on the monumental second day at Newlands. If Klusener could have used a fan, he probably would have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he stuck at it - thanks to the tolerance and faith of a piece of superb captaincy in adversity by Hansie Cronje. Even Eddie Barlow at his most belligerent would have approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Klusener, Bacher represents a full and fruitful future. A close-to-the- bat fielder that most captains can only dream of - witness his staggeringly sharp, thinking run-out of Srinath at Kingsmead - there is also the feeling that he will score a great many more test runs than his uncle Ali ever managed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bacher was also responsible for a memorable moment in finally getting rid of a dumbstruck Tendulkar for 169 of the best runs ever likely to be witnessed at Newlands with a catch that verged on the theatricality of major league baseball in its execution. It was one of those moments which shouldn't really have happened ... but did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In passing, it also went to building yet another block in a series that, while the Indians may have already lost the rubber after conceding two matches of the three, had thrown up enough mind-bends to wipe out the less memorable moments that it is equally capable of producing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect, it is perhaps germane to deviate north of the Limpopo and savour the hat-trick that Eddo Brandes - a part-timer whose advancing years as much as his geographical location make chicken farming a greater priority than international cricket - produced against Mike Atherton's Englishmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's destruction of the myth that the inventors of the game can actually play it, is proof positive that the Good Lord allowed the game to be invented for the ritual summer slaughter of the Brits and, in essence, that, despite the obligatory boundary ropes, there are no edges to this particular brand of sporting endeavour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there were, how would you really quantify the pace, control and psychological power over the opposing batsmen that Allan Donald has developed over the years? His art has been distilled into an alchemy with the ball in his hand that has all the hallmarks of the type of myth and mystery that surround the great names of yesteryear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 30, one would expect his talent to be on the wane. Clearly this is not the case. The deliveries he produced to dismiss Tendulkar at Kingsmead and the elegant left-hander Saurav Ganguly at Newlands were perhaps the finest of his long career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, too, with 37-year-old veteran Dave Richardson. He has shouldered the burden of a brittle top order for more tests than he would probably care to remember and seldom failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was heartening then that the old man of the side's sole stumping in a distinguished test career should have been handed to him by a teenager with an action that is an anathema to every spin bowling textbook ever written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Prasad danced down the wicket to Adams and left Richardson with little more to do than lift the bails, it symbolically forged the links between all that has been good about the national side in the past and everything that is to be expected of it in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite rightly, Hansie Cronje has warned not to take the Indians lightly - and certainly they are an eminently better advertisement for the game than Atherton's sorry English assortment - but even on the clearest of days in South Africa, there can be few sides capable of taking on this country's cricketing elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For, in everything, they have tried and tried hard. And this is what stretches the sporting borders. This is what elevates the ordinary to the excellent. We have indeed been privileged to watch it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - Africa has never won a medal at Olympic or world championship level in the throwing events. Some theorists - no doubt from the same school of thought which once asserted African physiology was not suited to running - have claimed that this is as a result of anatomical differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exploits of the Cubans, however, and discus throwers like African- American Anthony Washington and Nigeria's United States-based Adewale Olukoju, have long since debunked that myth. Africa's failure in these events is clearly a far simpler matter known as lack of opportunity. But that is about to change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week marks the low-key start of a campaign which former javelin world- record holder Tom Petranoff believes will go a long way towards changing this state of affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Christmas break, Petranoff will embark on a three-month-long programme to introduce his new invention - the turbojav - into South African schools in conjunction with the United Schools Sports Association of South Africa (USSASA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turbojav - which took Petranoff five years to perfect - is a small plastic javelin with an aerodynamic profile which ensures that it behaves as closely as possible to a real javelin while in flight. Equally important are its safety and durability which make it ideal for the use of young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the former US Olympian first came to live in South Africa in 1989 he got involved with coaching youngsters and found the javelin wasn't an easy event to teach. &quot;I realised there was a need for a training implement for kids that would enable them to throw, but wouldn't be a lethal weapon when brought into the school environment,&quot; recalls Petranoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he applied his mind to the problem and went through five different designs before the final model, Petranoff never got the turbojav off the ground until last year as he was training three or four hours a day and travelling a lot for competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only when he stopped competing at the beginning of 1995 and worked on the project full time that it began to bear fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petranoff used his various prototypes for coaching sessions at Katlehong's schools over the past three years. When he invited USSASA officials to come and see the model last year they were struck by its potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What was interesting was that the whole school got involved and all the kids were enjoying themselves. What was also impressive was that it flys like a real javelin and it doesn't break,&quot; remembers USSASA national director John O'Connor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the USSASA executive meeting in Bloemfontein last year, the turbojav was approved as an official event on the schools' sports programme for 1997. &quot;At most of the disadvantaged schools there were no javelins at primary school level and we have found since unity that kids from disadvantaged backgrounds have done alright in track events but not in the field events. We see the turbojav as an excellent tool to develop throwing skills. It's also very cheap,&quot; says O'Connor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not only in South Africa that interest has been shown in the turbojav.  Since manufacturing began in November, Petranoff has shipped nearly 10 000 units overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in South Africa though that he is most excited about the possible impact of the turbojav. For every turbojav sold one rand goes into a development fund for USSASA and the same amount into a similar fund for the National Paralympic Committee of South Africa. Those are two areas that have been close to Petranoff's heart in recent years and where his results have been evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His contribution to the overall success of the Amakrokakroka at the Paralympic Games is well known. The group of seven athletes coached by Petranoff brought back a total of 10 medals from Atlanta - every single one of them in the throws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lesser known fact is that Petranoff also has a 12-year-old girl in Katlehong who can throw the turbojav the substantial distance of 37m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For local sport to prosper more sportsmen and women with Petranoff's experience need to get involved in a hands'-on approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fruits of Petranoff's initiative and hard work may well be there for all to see in around eight years time - in Cape Town hopefully. Now wouldn't that be an appropriate place to put an end to one of the more incongruous traits of Olympics history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - It has not been a good week for the South African World Cup soccer squad with Clive Barker in hospital, Helman Mkhalele nursing an ankle injury and Mark Fish flying back to Rome instead of Lusaka. But disappointing dress rehearsals are no guarantee of disastrous opening nights and Bafana Bafana remain confident they can force at least a draw from the crucial qualifier against Zambia on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa opened their six-match Group 3 programme last November with a laboured 1-0 home victory over Zaire, while Zambia slumped to a shock 1-0 loss in the Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker has been such a central figure in the senior national squad for so long that his absence from the Marks Park training ground on Tuesday and Wednesday was noticeable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Phil Setshedi took charge and he is a quiet, unassuming man, less used to the cameras than the diminutive former professional footballer from Durban. Not that there was any disruption to normal service as Setshedi and Barker go back a long way, having worked together with Bafana Bafana since April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker was laid low by a stomach bug, with his two days in hospital largely a precautionary measure, and was due to fly north on Thursday morning with his 19- strong squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkhalele was the victim of a tackle by Eric Tinkler, the Italian-based midfielder who is the hard man of the squad, even at practice it seems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orlando Pirates hero, popularly known as Midnight Express, will be available for selection, but former club team-mate Fish is not as lucky, having been suspended by world controlling body Fifa for one match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Fish threw his toys out of the cot, who could blame him after another example of how far removed the South African Football Association (Safa) is from the real world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely someone at the mother body of football should have been aware of the rules regarding cautions, namely that if a player receives two in the World Cup, he is automatically suspended from the next cup tie. With so many complaints about firecrackers, perhaps they could be taken to Safa headquarters at Soccer City and set off to ensure officials become more alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fish, cautioned in Malawi last June for a raising his boot too high and again against Zaire for a late tackle, will be eligible for the third group match away to Congo during April. Make no mistake, the man whose flowing locks have given way to a close-cropped style, will be sorely missed after giving a world-class performance for Italian club Lazio against the multi- millionaires of AC Milan last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superbly timed interceptions, the well- placed clearances and the general defensive maturity were a joy to behold and made this writer confident that Zambia would find scoring difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it would be unfair and inaccurate to describe Bafana Bafana as Fish and 10 supporting actors, his absence cannot be underestimated and it could mean the difference between one point and none. When Barker announced his squad before Christmas he spoke boldly of attacking Zambia and going for broke. &quot;Everyone has to gamble sometime, and perhaps my time has come,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gorging themselves on these colourful comments, sections of the print and electronic media launched a hype attack, creating the impression that Bafana Bafana need only turn up in Lusaka to collect three points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing could be further from the truth as Zambia boast an outstanding home record in World Cup qualifiers and boast a full- strength team with midfielder Charles Musonda back following a three-year injury layoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambians have won 19 matches, drawn one and lost two, scored 64 goals and conceded 17 with the defeats coming against Algeria in 1985 and Zaire several decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While six goals against minnows Lesotho may not be cause for concern, four against Ethiopia (twice), Cameroon, Malawi, Morocco, Namibia, Senegal, Sudan, Uganda and Zaire certainly are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia have failed to score before their own supporters only three times and in the preliminary round last June, struck three past a Sudanese side that arrived in Lusaka with a two-goal advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warm-up matches for the South African tie included a 2-0 victory and 1-0 loss in Kenya and a 2-2 draw in Zimbabwe with a severely weakened team that allowed a two- goal lead to slip away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract of Danish coach Roald Poulsen was not renewed following the loss to Congo, and Freddie Mwila, a 50-year disciplinarian, took charge with Samuel &quot;Zoom&quot; Ndhlovu lending technical assistance. Most of the names in the Zambian squad are familiar and everyone is united behind the &quot;Chipolopolo&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strike over non-payment of R270 bonuses following the tour of Kenya is history, inspirational captain and midfielder Kalusha Bwalya is back from Mexico and the stage is set for a titanic Southern Africa showdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker discovered a long time ago that even successes like winning the African Nations Cup do not stop the sniping of some critics who point to a team unproven on foreign fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, the South Africans have played only six away matches under Barker, but after two losses in Australia at the beginning of his reign, the coach has a record of three wins and one draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draw came in Lusaka during the 1996 Nations Cup qualifiers, a match Bafana Bafana looked like winning until Philemon Masinga conceded a late penalty kick which Kenneth Malitoli converted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victory this weekend would be like marrying your sweetheart and winning a R1-million lottery the same afternoon, but a draw would also be a good result, guaranteed to keep Bafana Bafana on the road to France.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - It is one of the inevitable facts that, having placed the focus on making the FNB Tour part of the European Circuit, that the major focus on professional golf will centre on three weeks in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, there is little else that the South African PGA could have done but to piggyback the European Tour if tournament golf was to survive in this country. The distances alone - even without the Disney- like disappearance of any real value that the rand might once have held - make this so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money elsewhere is just too big for this embattled economy to compete on equal terms in all but the three showpiece tournaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For it is in the R3,375-million MTN- Mercedes SA Open at beautiful Glendower, the R3,15-million Dimension Data Pro-am at the Lost City and the R2,25-million Alfred Dunhill PGA at Houghton that now properly define the tour proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even then, these do not add up to major tournaments likely to attract the big names. Yes, there are three back-to-back events and, to paraphrase the old song, the living for professionals in this country using real money is both cheap and easy. But coming to South Africa is a long way from home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are quite likely, if no appearance money changes hands, to see the same crop of players riding just below the cusp on the European tour as we did last time out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Ernie Els will doubtless start at least two of the big three and rekindle the interest anew, but one man never makes a tournament on his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, in many ways, does the rest of the tournaments - and their sponsors - an injustice, for none of the other four events on the roster is worth less than half a million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we are faced with the prospect of the old faithfuls, and the stay-at- home pros shooting it out for the titles which carry, in some instances, less by way of a winner's cheque in dollar or sterling terms than would be the case on one of the satellite circuits abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the price we have had to pay in this country for competing against the attractions elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will show in the coming week when the first of seven tournaments which make up the tour proper after the break ffrom the Nedbank Million at Sun City, a sojourn in Zimbabwe and the priceless victory in the World Cup by Els and Wayne Westner at Erinvale before the festive season shattered the illusion of a cohesive circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;opener&quot; is the R750 000 San Lameer SA Masters where Westner will defend the title that led the way to his order of Merit truimph last season.  Westner's biggest potential rival is the seemingly ageless Mark McNulty, winner of three European titles last time round,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNulty and Westner have stayed loyal to the roots they sunk into the professional game on the local tour and have it in them to make the tour take off. But, it must be said, this is a big task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tournaments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan 16-19 SA Masters, San Lameer R750 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan 23-26 Nashua Wild Coast Challenge, Wild Coast Sun R750 000</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - MADAM, THIS IS ANNIE by Dianne Case (Macmillan Modern Writers, R39)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following in the tradition of The Long Journey of Poppie Nongena and, more recently, The Calling of Katie Makanya, this novel recounts the history of Annie, a black domestic servant. Each of its 83 short chapters (some no longer than a few lines) takes the form of an interior monologue addressed to her white employer, &quot;Madam&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This device works quite well in relating Annie's experiences, emotions and ideas. There is, however, an inherent danger of sounding patronising (as in the &quot;Ooh Madam&quot; chapter headings) when assuming the voice of a less educated person. Funnily enough, it is when Dianne Case forgets to use the &quot;simple&quot; English of a servant that the monologue rings most true: &quot;I am just so alone - I wish I had somebody who could have a cup of tea with me and listen to me while I open my heart and talk my troubles out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set in the last days of apartheid, this book will touch a chord for many readers, not least in its depiction of the relationship between two women of very different backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VANISHING SHADOWS by Namige Kayondo (Macmillan Modern Writers, R39)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS short novel - more of a novella, really - is Namige Kayondo's first venture into fiction and makes a brave attempt at coming to terms with the Aids epidemic. Although he shies away from a tragic conclusion, the story he tells confronts many of the issues with insight and intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book focuses mainly on Ttiisa, a young woman living in Kampala, and Dona, a young man trying to escape the boredom and humiliation of unemployment. The supporting characters of family and friends are equally well drawn, from Ttiisa's mother, who has fallen in love at what her daughter considers an unsuitable age, to the rather appealing young gangsters who put temptation in Dona's way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the central theme is a sad one, there is much humour, pleasure and (as the title may suggest) light in Vanishing Shadows - a promising debut from a talented Ugandan writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE BOOK OF INTIMATE GRAMMAR by David Grossman (Picador, R45,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Grossman is one of Israel's leading novelists, with several books to his name and a reputation for fine, lyrical prose rich in metaphor. This is certainly true of The Book of Intimate Grammar which - in this excellent translation - has a wonderful fluency, freshness and wit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the action is seen through the eyes of a child, Aron Kleinfeld, who experiences all the agonies, self-consciousness and embarrassments of the very young. Here he is mortified by his father's boorishness: &quot;Papa slurped and gulped while Aron sipped politely to correct the bad impression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he grows up things don't get any easier. Worst of all is his own first experience of love and betrayal: &quot;The inward Aron cried and cried, and through his sweat-blinded eyes and twitching face he imagined a gloomy little cloud there, a puff of loss and loneliness ...&quot; When The Book of Intimate Grammar first appeared in English in 1994, the London Guardian described it as &quot;a grave and lovely book&quot;. One can't improve on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE VISITATION by Sue Reidy (Black Swan, R42,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOT to be confused with Mich_le Roberts's 1983 book of the same name, The Visitation is Sue Reidy's first novel. She has, however, published several collections of short fiction and been awarded the Katharine Mansfield Short Story Prize in her native New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This longer work - described by Fay Weldon as &quot;a delicious novel: touching, true, very funny and intensely readable&quot; - concerns two sisters growing up in the late Sixties. Belonging to a large Catholic family in a small New Zealand town, the two girls invent their own games of virgins and martyrs, while their mother dreams of a very different existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a well written and amusing novel of family life, of growing up and of the shocks encountered in the process. Most surprising of these is the realisation that the truth is seldom absolute but can come in many versions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - The Road Out by Dan Wylie (Snailpress, R34)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Wylie is one of those hopeless romantics whose CVs include, as a matter of necessity, extended detours into solitary, footloose travelling, shunting, ship- crewing and intermittent writing. Eventually these voyagers return to one of the points of departure, get a job teaching or working on a newspaper, and turn the journey inward. In Wylie's case, The Road Out is decidedly a road back into the self.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is evident from a key poem in Wylie's collection, called Secretly.  Here the poet confesses that he keeps &quot;searching for the gate out of the garden&quot;, the site of both his enchantment and his confinement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The garden, with its tangles of bougainvillea hooking the poet's history in its &quot;tendrils and thorns&quot;, is the individual imagination, that close, rotting place with its ever-changing borders and delightful recesses - a place of beckoning but also of entrapment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on the fairy-tale archetype, Wylie asks: &quot;and if I were to find a green door,/ and turn the rusted key?&quot; He realises that he would then &quot;tramp&quot; from ocean to ocean, beating at the staves of the sky, looking for the stairwell back to myself, there being no other landfall, or measure, or wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the delight in reading Wylie's verse is precisely the extravagant deployment of metaphor, often seemingly for its own sake, and the sudden, disconcerting turns from metaphor into literality, a wonderful technique when it works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His is the kind of writing persona that seems to exist by imagining every lived moment as a moment of telling - life as narration. Hence, walking down the road, &quot;I slouch towards work/ across jacarandas' violent aftermath/ where jacketed bees rifle the limp pockets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an observing voice which seeks out violent conjunctions of inner feeling and exterior description: &quot;In the garrulous plumbing of stacked apartments/ a thousand versions of the past shudder and hiss&quot; (Research in Maritzburg).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, one may well ask, should anyone read this? Why should the navel-gazing of a former Zimbabwean now turned English lecturer in Grahamstown interest anyone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My answer is: for the sheer selfish pleasure of the pyrotechnics in his lyrical description of conditions. The conditions themselves hardly matter (ending a love affair, loving older women, looking at gannets, various reflections on the condition of an inner life).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lyrical poetry about the interiority of an &quot;I&quot; which, if successful, resonates within the inner lives of others, has had a very bad press in this country. Yet the &quot;I&quot; voice is widespread and quite normal in the poetry of other English-speaking cultures where lyrical utterance has been less the subject of prescription and surveillance than in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The condition, of course, is that the inner voice must be bridged in language which is able to lead readers into a kind of recognition which is also a shifting - a momentary sense of being taken back into, but away from oneself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the delight of good poetry, a negligible but exquisite thing.  Wylie's poems occasionally niggle, and they're not uniformly brilliant.  That's because he lives dangerously as a poet, and I like that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - WOZA SHAKESPEARE!: Titus Andronicus in South Africa by Antony Sher and Gregory Doran (Methuen, R130)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE is a fine South African exclamation to express human sympathy - &quot;ag shame&quot;. Said with a certain tone, it also means &quot;look what you deserve!&quot; Here are poor Tony and Greg, mounting their big Shakespeare number in Africa, and didn't they have a tough time? Well, ag shame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who actually witnessed their baleful, misguided Titus Andronicus - not many, for the hordes stayed away - clearly something basic had not been thought through. Once you begin hoping Lavinia will have more than her hands chopped off, you know it's trouble.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was the great polymath, Antony Sher, in daft Afrikaner regalia, doing in a supermarket trolley - checking if the meat was off? Often incomprehensible, their Titus Andronicus was a poor show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, to have the book of it, with lots of cheap retaliation for their bad reception, is almost too much. Sher alternates with his director-lover, bouncing it all between their own reflecting mirrors, quoting one another (indeed, confusing one another). Clearly an inviolable pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they never seem to pick up the import of their double-act. That other queen (of England, who was touring simultaneously) and the Sher-Doran performance were flops because South Africans, now world leaders in democratic procedures, have become bored with mouldy royals patronising them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some would say using &quot;Woza&quot; (meaning come or arise) in their title takes nerve, but as Sher is South African-born, perhaps he has the right. My own feeling is that, since he doesn't bother to spell any other South African word correctly, he should forfeit it. But that is not a serious matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is is that, out of absolutely nothing but talent, the original Woza Albert! kept all of unfunded, censorship-darkened anti- apartheid theater going for decades. All the Sher-Doran mess has managed to do is collapse it.  Our Market Theater still has not recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that you would expect a subtlety like that from their self-regarding twaddle. The sketches (by Sher) are quite cute. Shame indeed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - RIGHT now we're living through South Africa's Renaissance, say the Soweto String Quartet. &quot;It's in all aspects of life. It's an awakening, a rebirth, as well as in the redefining of South African arts.  Europe had a Renaissance, now it's our turn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quartet have just brought out their second album, entitled Renaissance (BMG), in honour of that idea. And just as the Renaissance in Europe was born of the powerful, mercantile Italian city states, there's also a political basis for this idea in the here and now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our country,&quot; says Makhosini Mnguni (viola), &quot;is now a model of peace and reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; says Reuben Khemese (cello), &quot;now Unita leader Jonas Savimbi is talking to President Mandela in an attempt to settle Angola and give them a government of national unity. We regard this country as the mother country of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuben is the oldest of the three brothers in the group. Sandile Khemese, who studied in Manchester and Soweto, plays first violin, and Thami plays second violin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their first album, 1995's Zebra Crossing, had the industry buzzing. It won Best New Artist, Best Instrumental Performance and Best Pop Album in that year's FNB/South African Music Awards. It went platinum at home and in New Zealand, and gold in Australia and Spain, where the group has been dubbed Los Violinistas de Mandela, in recognition of the fact that they play regularly at functions for the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a group that used to rehearse in a disused public toilet, they've come a long way. Now they drive two BMWs painted in zebra stripes and have played all over Europe, in Australia and New Zealand. This year they'll be touring South Africa before going overseas again, this time to Spain and France, Oz again, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and possibly the United States. None of the dates have been finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They still live in Soweto. After all, you can't call yourself the Soweto String Quartet and live in Sandton, can you? Indeed, the interview was conducted on the grass under a shady tree in Dobsonville, Soweto, on the grounds of one of Credo Mutwa's former homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first home of the Khemeses, though, was Sophiatown, where they were all born to a deeply musical family committed to fine church singing. The notorious forced removals from the area were part of their formative childhood experiences. No wonder then, that one of the tracks on Renaissance is called Sophiatown, in recognition and celebration of the restoration of the area's original name - and the dumping of the insulting title of Triomf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church singing of their youth, says Sandile Khemese, &quot;culminated in a very sophisticated ear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we started playing violins, we didn't have problems with intonation.  Our uncle, Michael Masote, started a music school in Soweto in 1965. Myself and Reuben were among the first violin students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's all in the family. Indeed, Kutlwano Masote, Michael's son, is a cellist currently studying in Switzerland at Lord Yehudi Menuhin's school in Gstaadt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makhosini Mnguni, slightly younger than the around-40 Khemeses, also comes from a strong musical background. His brother plays jazz clarinet and he started on jazz trumpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I saw Sandile playing and I was impressed, so I started studying with Sandile and Thami.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Masote's school produced a youth orchestra playing classical music in which the four participated. But in 1978 they went out on their own and formed the quartet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did a lot of corporates and experimented with African music. We found the response positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've no regrets we've moved from pure classical,&quot; says Sandile Khemese. &quot; Classical is good for discipline though.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with their previous album, it's a blend of acoustic string playing and instrumentation like bass, guitars and drums. Renaissance, though, includes keyboards which, to these ears, makes it a slightly smoother production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the most beautiful, moving piece is probably Dvorak's Songs My Mother Taught Me, played straight and recorded live. Which is not to decry their Imbube, Weeping (sung by Vusi Mahlasela and also unspeakably high on the emotional scale), Mangwane/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ee'Motswala or their own five compositions, including Blue Fountain and Eureka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing with our music,&quot; says Thami Khemese, &quot;is that we've managed to come up with a different sound, with no age, cultural or geographical boundaries. It can be listened to by everyone. It's accessible - and it brings joy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what on earth can be wrong with that?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - The life and death of Johannesburg artist Neil Goedhals inspired as much myth-making as his work inspired emulation. Six years after his death, his memory and the legacy he bequeathed to a younger generation of conceptual artists retains a fuzzy-edged, tinted aura usually reserved for cult figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An epileptic, he died at the Christ-like age of 33 by diving - some say falling - off the roof of his Yeoville apartment block in mid-1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet posthumous mystique cannot cloud the fact that Goedhals was one of the pioneers of conceptualism in South Africa. He was employing maps and found objects - the residue of ready-made mass culture - as well as confronting issues of the body politic at a time when the former belonged to the cartographer's lexicon and the latter was bandied about only at academic conventions. He revelled in a &quot;styleless&quot; style, feigned amateurism and explored differing artistic traditions - even dabbled in numerology - to expose the arbitrariness of meaning and fight artistic mediocrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though his works were visually banal, his play on words and images and his archive of references - from Wopko Jensma to the Kabbalah - were extraordinary in depth and breadth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in acknowledgement of his ongoing influence that art dealer Warren Siebrits has curated Black (on the) Inside - a suitably sparse exhibition based around a single work by Goedhals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not only the piece itself that invites attention. It is also the relationship between this work and another co-exhibited piece produced by Kendell Geers during his student years which reveals the influence he exerted on the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geers's work consists of a giant tyre with part of the racist rhyme, Eenie Meenie Mynie Mo, written on it. Produced in the 1980s, the work makes reference to the &quot;necklacing&quot; method of justice meted out to apartheid's informants. Deliberately crude and abrasive, it encapsulates the time and place in which it was executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goedhals's work, although also apparently simple in execution, is more layered. Produced between 1987 and 1990 it includes a street map of Johannesburg on which Goedhals has traced his bearings, both autobiographical and artistic. The other side includes a geometrical diagram on which the word &quot;lazy&quot; is written in lettraset and &quot;failed map&quot; is scrawled in his handwriting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The words nullify the documents - and by implication the institutions - that separate us into different categories of identification, location and achievement. They suggest Goedhals's anger towards a culture of mediocrity that refuses to engage critically with information. By disfiguring official documents, he transforms them from objects of authority to objects of art(ifice).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet as radical as the work was when it was first produced, if one looks at Goedhals's art in relation to the flashy one-liners currently being churned out by some of his conceptualist progeny, Geodhals seems strangely traditional, even aesthetic, by comparison. What was once marginalised has, inevitably, become mainstream. This irony would probably have amused Goedhals.  His response to some of the &quot;star-tists&quot; who have risen in his wake might be somewhat different.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - The undisputed winner of the Mail &amp; Guardian's Not the Pirelli Calendar Prize for 1997 is the calendar put out by the women's support group, Powa (People Opposing Women Abuse).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A collaborative project between the organisation and the Fine Arts Department at the University of the Witwatersrand, the calendar consists of provocative images produced in various media and genres.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are accompanied by extracts from feminist writings which confront the issue of women's abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But instead of resorting to the obvious and simply perpetuating pictures of women as passive victims, the imagery is refreshingly assertive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calendar's overriding message seems to be that while women might continue to be victims of abuse they are no longer prepared to suffer and be still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted the calendar to be socially relevant and simultaneously accessible to people across the board,&quot; explains artist and fine arts lecturer Penny Siopis who, together with fellow artist and Wits lecturer Jo Ractliffe, co-ordinated the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The workshop phase took several months in terms of discussion and design and the project was tackled with enormous enthusiasm by the students - both collaboratively and on an individual basis,&quot; according to Siopis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The process was cathartic for some students who had had personal experience of abuse, and an eye-opener for those who were stunned by the stories related to them by representatives from Powa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African music explosion is a bit like God.  Journalists resurrect it yearly, Barney Simon preaches it daily, but mankind never gets to see it. The Oppikoppi Moerit Boetie festival, which is held near Sun City, is set to change that.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For five days, white-boy rawkers replaced Bushveld civility with noise.  Along with the music there was also bushveld, bushveld and kids flying on 11 herbs and spices screaming: &quot;Ons is vrye koeie! (we are free cows)&quot; before rushing off into the bushveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we stuffed our boots under the shrink's couch, tried to ignore the fact that the last Oppikoppi festival resulted in a bushfire, and prepared to spin out to 1997. First up on the bill were the legendary Naaimasjiene in their first appearance since their banning seven years ago. Possibly the only band in the world with alternatiewe Afrikaner bellydancers, the Naaimasjiene had the crowd in hysterics over their agitrock lyrics and hard grooves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hit of the festival were, however, Dorp, who bruised and cruised through their set with all the energy of a streaker at Queen Victoria's funeral and had the crowd bopping away to their infectious brand of rock. The drummer kept up a relentless beat as they rushed offstage beating pots.  Definitely the name to watch for in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The much-hyped Famous Curtain Trick provided light airy pop after the splintering Dorp. But if you're going to listen to girlie rock, forget Famous Curtain Trick and their CNN accent and get wise to Henry Ate. Despite being short of a drummer, they slinked by on cute appeal and some fine acoustic material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day Two and I was sitting around waiting for something besides my New Year's resolutions to kick in. Then the mighty industrial sounds of Battery Nege began terrifying the wildlife. Songs like Kiss the Machine and Vatso Jou Booswig consolidated Battery Nege's hardcore reputation. When the crowd screamed for more, Paul and his crew showed their ironic side and played an unplugged version of the Macarena. As Koos Kombuis would say: &quot;Ai, ai. Weird, weird scene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite some great bands, the local rock scene also offers a lot of mediocrity. Bands, who scream &quot;play more local&quot;, rehash the same old tired formulas and clich's. But you can't sell this to the kids who know what they want. When you have to throw T-shirts to get people to dance, you know its time for change. When they throw them back, its time to break up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day Three, and Ark took to the stage. I hit the beer tent as they went through all the same old moves. But then it was time for Billygoat. They delivered a raucous concoction of moonshine and cowpunk. Plum played as though their insane-in-the-brain funk hybrid was as effortless as spliffing up and dropping out. The crowd rinkhalsed along despite the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day Four (or is it Five)? As enough reefers were smoked to float a small hot-air balloon, White Trash's vocalist sang with the fort' of Tom Waits going down on the Titanic. Songs like PMS Junkie were a psychotic screamfest, but the rest of the band never really kept up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was nearing midnight and the legendary Valiant Swart intimidated the old year into submission with hard-edged rock. It was time to kick back with some homegrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oppikoppi festival is setting the timer on the South African music explosion and breeding the next generation of terrorists. We have some fine white-boy rawk to look forward to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - Here's the bad news: 1997 promises to be pretty much like 1996 all over again. Wall- to-wall space aliens and natural disasters. If you can't face the prospect, you could always hibernate all year with a stout volume of Henry James. But that won't help you forget the movies - he's this year's favoured classic author, with Jane Campion's The Portrait of a Lady, and The Wings of the Dove to follow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you managed to opt out of Independence Day, you won't escape intergalactic duty in 1997. I've just seen the trailer for a forthcoming three-part astral epic, and it'll be hard work to top this one - Star Wars, 20 years old and still the flashiest zap-gun opera since stardate whenever.  The next batch of galactic hopefuls include: the new Robert Zemeckis epic Contact, with Jodie Foster; Tommy Lee Jones chasing aliens in Men in Black; Tim Burton's extravagant Mars Attacks; and Alien IV, which promises to be the darkest, strangest yet, directed by Jeunet of the Delicatessen team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also looming: giant space insects in Starship Troopers, Paul Verhoeven's mega- budget follow-up to Showgirls (lap-dancing cockroaches?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insects are altogether on the march this year, with rival animations in the works from Toy Story director John Lasseter (Bugs) and Spielberg's new DreamWorks (Ants). Or to avoid confusion, you could try the real-life wriggles of French documentary Microcosmos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one's yet planning a locust-plague film, but it can't be far off, as the natural catastrophe cycle continues in the wake of Twister - two bubbling- lava movies, Volcano and Dante's Peak, not to mention The Flood. Then there's James Cameron's Titanic, which may be his Waterworld, with a budget creeping up to an unthinkable $130-million. With JG Ballard currently a hot ticket after Crash, who'll be first to take on his disaster books The Drowned World and The Drought? Likely to trample all over the 50th anniversary of Cannes are more dinosaurs, in Spielberg's Jurassic Park sequel The Lost World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more adult pursuits, there's The Game, a paranoid thriller by David Fincher (Seven); Milos Forman returns with the tale of an all-American pornographer, The People Vs Larry Flynt; and Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient will cause mass outbreaks of swooning (it's either the passion or the desert heat).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For culture, there's the long haul with Kenneth Branagh's uncut Hamlet (just when you thought it was safe to come out from behind the arras), but the hipster vote goes to Baz Luhrmann's drugs-guns-and- fashion Romeo and Juliet. Woody Allen's musical Everyone Says I Love You will, at the very least, have better tunes than Evita. Britain's entries into the fray will include Mike Leigh's latest, and the first American foray by the Trainspotting team. Comeback of the year, let's hope, will be David Lynch, whose Lost Highway is said to be wild at heart and weird all the way through.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This year promises to be the brightest in years for South Africa's film industry, with loads of movies in development and several sure to see their first day of shooting some time during 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Wicht of Film Afrika Worldwide (who co-produced One Man, One Vote, now boringly titled Mandela and De Klerk) is upbeat about the prospects for the year - what with up to five features his company is either producing or co-producing. Local productions include Wild Card, a thriller set in SA and Mozambique, penned and to be directed by Brian Tilley (The Line); First Crime, a family murder saga set in the Cape, to be directed by Revel Fox; and a re- make of Disney's Sammy Going South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International co-productions on Wicht's company's itinerary include Tarzan and Jane and, after more than 10 years waiting, the Stander gang movie which renowned director Barbet Schroeder (Barfly) is to helm after uncovering one of the story's many scripts in Los Angeles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's going to be an exciting year,&quot; says Wicht, &quot;but as for fully local productions we've got a chicken-and-egg situation. Local writers and directors need a track record. I believe to get our local talent producing, emerging writers and directors have to make pictures for zilch money so that we can produce, say, a slate of interesting pictures that'll prove our talent.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading actors' agent Moonyeen Lee is equally realistic, though in her customary feisty style, a little less optimistic - especially regarding the commitment of government and the national broadcaster. She minces no words: &quot; The SABC has no fucking money. They're not even paying repeat fees. It's all going to affirmative action. I don't believe the government takes film seriously. They're out to lunch ... literally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology's R10-million for film development seems to be stuck in a mire of maladministration with no formal application procedures and a laissez-faire sense of accountability.  But as Lee adds: &quot;The industry is furiously primed to take off, we have the talent, our actors alone can hold their own alongside any major names in the film world.&quot; A point validated by one of her clients Lionel Newton, who delivers a blistering, award-winning performance in Les Blair's Jump the Gun due for national release later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanjeev Singh of Videovision concurs: &quot;But people must realise, government as well, that it's an industry not a game.&quot; Last year the company produced Katinka Heyns's rural Afrikaans fantasy drama Paljas, which they hope to premiere at Cannes this year. Although seemingly risky, Heyns is probably the country's only bankable art movie director, having had five features break even or actually make money. The company is notable for being adventurous in the titles it picks up for distribution. In terms of production, they seem more cautious, making low-budget genre pictures in the United States with their only local film up for this year being the film of Mandela's book, Long Walk to Freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Videovision star director Darrell Roodt has two pictures coming up this year, one a tale about the red mercury scandal and another based in Namibia, Sanctuary. Roodt is off to the US to confirm finance with Warner Brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Angus Gibson and finance man Isaac Shongwe of the Laduma Film Factory are being constructive about the ideals and realities of creating a local industry. Says Shongwe, &quot;Financiers look around at our rainbow nation, but no one's taking a chance. It's like they'll only have the courage to make a rugby or cricket movie.&quot; The company is intrepidly developing young talent with Street Bash, a Soweto gangster pic written by up-and-coming talent Tebogo Mohlatse, set to go into production later this year with Gibson directing. &quot;Our interest is to create an environment, a space for people to create a story that is unusual but uniquely South African.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly progressive is newly formed Cape Town company Big World which is actually paying young talent for an option on their scripts. Projects lined up for this year include Roger Young's Trilogy, Barry Berk's blackly comic take on Yeoville, Numb, and a screen adaptation of Ashraf Jamal's novel about life in Cape Town's Observatory, Love Themes for the Wilderness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Cape Town producer/director Johan Blignaut is also optimistic about the chances of movie-making this year. As administrator of Showdata, SA's only webpage dedicated to the film and TV industry (email to admin@showdata.org.za with &quot;subscribe bulletin&quot; in the subject field), he found finance for two of his upcoming projects from France and the Netherlands through cyberspace. Says Blignaut, &quot;Our colleagues in the industry need to wake up. Especially with regard to marketing themselves. We simply have to go out there and hunt the big guys down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - Like the butcherman in your dreams, he lies there in the slaughterhouse of art. Sliced at the throat, and at the underhang of his fleshy arm. In a pose. Still-life. But look closer at his veins. They are still, but blue with life. There's a pinkness around those eyes and behind the knees. Look at those heels. There's blood in them for sure. But he's at rest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first glance you do feel like you've stepped into a slaughterhouse of human bodies. &quot;They're naked but not nude,&quot; says bright young Durban artist Aliza Levi as we crouch down to inspect her first wax figure. A fragile, most vulnerable male with flaccid penis seems resigned to reveal himself as the unheroic male. &quot;Each figure deals with the assumptions we have with the body.  This figure deals with the reversal of masculinity. So often in the media or movies and in history of art, we are confronted with the heroic, standing up, active pose of men with an erect penis. We rarely see the fragile male.  Seemingly we are not allowed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Levi, recent winner of the R20 000 Emma Smith Award for 1996 is about to change all that. As an undergraduate in anthropology and psychology (at the University of Cape Town) and recently graduating in fine art from Technikon Natal, Levi has always been fascinated with the human figure. &quot;I've been obsessed by the spine most of all. It's quite bizarre. But it's because it's so fragile, yet it's the backbone of the body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levi is interested in the naked versus the nude. &quot;Seldom do we display what is truly naked about ourselves because we are continually building facades with which to present to society. So the individuals I have chosen to sculpt, and to exhibit, I have presented as real, as actual and as naked as I have been able. To show the flesh, to expose the vulnerability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very intimate as I have to rub down the models with vaseline before I take bandages and dip them into plaster and place them over the body. More than having removed clothes from these bodies, the models have helped me to reveal a contemplative moment of their inner selves.&quot; And most poignantly Levi has revealed as she hoped: &quot;The marginal status of the 'non-ideal' body - the body that does not fit into expected social norms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She ensures the body reflects an individual realism with the use of wax and oil paints on the surface. &quot;I love working with wax - look what you can do,&quot; she says, excitedly tracing her fine fingers across a multitude of pin-like punctures on the skin. But it's the feet and hands that are quite phenomenal.  You expect them to twitch at any moment. Or perhaps a leg may stretch or a body may turn over to lie in a different position. Although it's still-life, there is certainly life in these figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition can be seen from January 13 to 29 at Technikon Natal, Level S4 in Durban. For private viewing contact (031) 204-2096</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - The first time I saw a Gibson Kente production was some time in the 1970s. Instead of dispatching my siblings and me to grandmother for their night out, my parents decided to take us along to the theater. The play was called I Believe. I recall the name of the play; of the plot I recall nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The playwright's name, however, was to stay with me for most of my youth, like the nagging strains of a song that lingers in the mind. The tune of this music was somehow different. It depended on who was singing it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the music of admiration from the lips of white university literature lecturers dubbing him &quot;the father of township theater&quot;. In return, they could christen themselves radical. It was the music of derision from black drama students dismissing him as unskilled in subtlety, in return acquiring a halo of higher education. It was the music of adulation from the lips of township folk who called him &quot;Bra Gib&quot; and packed his houses to the rafters - quite literally at times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the man surrounded by a group of eager youngsters hanging on to his every word as he talks about &quot;the artistic eye&quot;. This is the man who asks the cast of his latest play, Mfowethu, &quot;Are we together folks?&quot;. This is the man to whom they respond in unison, &quot;Together!&quot; You need to have seen a Kente production to appreciate that this is a Kenteism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is also the man who sighs: &quot;Sometimes actors can let you down, you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this is the man who, in 1959 as a social worker and a wannabe composer, sought a collaboration with a playwright to produce a play. His music was to drive the words of the partner. &quot;I looked to no avail and decided that I should write the play myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manana, the Jazz Prophet was born, and this first child gave birth to the father of black theater. &quot;Manana was based on the influences of religious entertainment,&quot; he says of the play. &quot;It was about this guy who felt that he could draw kids away from the streets into the church by giving services that would entertain them.&quot; At the time this was an issue that was important to people, he says, adding: &quot;Most of my stories are based on what people are interested in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He drops a clanger by dismissing an interest in presentations of political content: &quot;I am not much of person of politics.&quot; Rather surprising in view of the fact that in the dark days of apartheid, Kente was detained for what he was writing. And equally surprising in view of the fact that he provoked the ire of the United Democratic Front's cultural desk in the 1980s by staging an anti-sanctions play, Bad Times Mzala. Counting them on his fingers, he concludes that of the 25-odd plays he has written and produced only &quot;about six or seven of them have an overtly political content&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what about his new work? Has he, in retrospect, changed his tune? &quot;One of the things that I pride myself in is that I will not bend to either side of the political spectrum. I wrote what I felt.&quot; Which means he still feels that the sanctions he was railing against in the 1980s continue to do damage in our post- apartheid society. &quot;I actually feel stronger about them now than I did then because the present government cannot deliver,&quot; he says, explaining that &quot;it all started with sanctions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kente will no doubt leave an indellible mark on the face of local theater.  After all, the likes of the world-famous Mbongeni Ngema have learnt their craft at his hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the sake of posterity, I want to know, are there any records of his plays? &quot;You know, when you ask me that question you hurt me,&quot; he says. All of his plays and recordings were destroyed by a fire in 1989. Needless to say, this has presented a few problems - not the least of which being the fact that director Jerry Mofokeng, in an attempt to restage one of Kente's early classics, Lifa, has had to rewrite the play from the memories of the original cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, with the new dispensation in place the father of township theater has not had much luck in the way of hits. Mama's Love, his foray into televion, was not the success it was meant to be. The touches of Kente were still there but the presentation was too big for television. It seemed as if the transition from stage to television was proving to be too much. It seemed that the magic was gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledges that it was slightly over the top and that &quot;I could have spent more time with the actors, with the product, toning it down to the degree it needed to be in.&quot; He says that even when the series was on, he and his actors watched it religiously. &quot;We watched it with our eyes and our pens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While his last attempt at television had its hiccups, he has not abandoned the medium. &quot;I love television, those subtleties, those nuances.&quot; With that love he has accepted an SABC commission to adapt his play, What a Shame, for television. It is to be renamed Lahliwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time it's going to be better,&quot; he says. One can only hope so, even if it is out of sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lifa will be performed by the original cast from April 8 at the Civic Theater, Johannesburg; Lahliwe, currently being reworked, will be screened on SABC1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The beginning of a new year, when the brain of the average homo sapiens oscillates between inspired ideals for a fresh start and the lethargy that spills over from a holiday break, is a timely moment to get back to basics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the World Wide Web, the basics on almost any topic under the Net are to be found in documents that fall under the generic title of FAQs. Yes, that is a dirty word, seeing it stands for Frequently Asked Questions, and they never seem to answer the questions you ask most frequently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a few secrets to believing in FAQs, though. For instance, many a FAQ is written to sell a product, with the marketing message disguised as a question and answer session. When FAQs are linked from major information resources on the web, they tend to have attained a level of recognition, and can be taken as more definitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let's start at the beginning. You want a FAQ on a particular topic.  Chances are, there is a Usenet newsgroup (see the pointer to the Usenet FAQ below) on the topic and, where there is a newsgroup, there is invariably a FAQ as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding and participating in the appropriate newsgroup can be a long-winded way to find a FAQ, though, so your starting point should be somewhere on the web. Somewhere like the FAQfinder (http://ps.superb.net/FAQ/), which lists thousands of FAQs in categories ranging from Art, Audio and Comedy to Sports, Technology and TV Shows. Oh, and, somewhere between, you'll also find Computers, Internet and Programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, before you imagine this is your instant pathway to ultimate knowledge, bear in mind that anyone can add their own FAQs to the database.  As the world's storehouse of knowledge is thus built up, so is a vast pool of mis-, dis- and mal-information. One Shawn Berry came across enough of these latter class of FAQs to express his distress to the world. He created The World's Most Useless FAQs (http://www.ptbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">igs.net/ shawn/useless-faq.html) page to alert us to all that is evil in the world of FAQdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His criteria included asking whether a FAQ sounds like a self-serving promotional tool rather than information source and whether it contributes to the global body of knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His list of The World's Most Useless FAQs starts with the likes of &quot;the very snotty &amp; arrogant rec.humor FAQ&quot; and includes &quot;The Jihad to Destroy Barney FAQ&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're in a rush to get to the easy stuff like the World Wide Web, go to the World Wide Web FAQ (http://www.boutell.com/faq/), which takes you from web browsers and web servers through to authoring web pages, images and scripts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And visit the online version of this column, at http://www.mg.co.za/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mg/pc/pcrevie1.htm, for direct links to the above sites as well as other key FAQs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - @ Keeper of the global gate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert Murdoch is way ahead of his media competition. Henry Porter wonders if anybody realises his power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN Full Disclosure, Andrew Neil's telling account of his life as a Murdoch editor, he reveals that Rupert Murdoch's presence is so strong in News International that he appears to his executives in their dreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pity that politicians have not shared his experience of being woken in the night by the vision of Murdoch. If they had, they might begin to dwell on how thoroughly his personality has penetrated Britain's affairs; and they would almost certainly scrutinise the strategy that is about to give his company an unparalleled advantage in national broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the deed is practically done and if you talk to politicians, broadcasters, government departments and the regulatory bodies charged with overseeing the introduction of digital broadcasting by BSkyB in a year's time, you find a mixture of trust, ignorance and defeatism that can only result in commercial triumph for Murdoch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People seem simply not to grasp the implications of digital broadcasting and the speed with which Murdoch is moving to introduce it by satellite. They don't see how much power will accrue to this foreign national, nor even the danger his company, News Corp, represents to what is an essential and ill- guarded part of British culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, the subject of digital television requires concentration but it shouldn't mesmerise quite the number of officials that it does. They insist Murdoch will have to behave, although there is scant evidence of his ever having respected a British institution or any of its regulations. Murdoch is global now, and national governments are only interesting to him inasmuch as they may help or impede his enormous ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand what is at stake, you must grasp the technical advances in television. In a nutshell, digital broadcasting is the transmission of high- quality TV along frequencies previously not powerful enough to be used for TV.  Because the signal travels in bites of information rather than the conventional analog, it may be compressed during transmission and then decompressed when it reaches a TV set. Vast amounts of information may therefore be carried and this will enable, for instance, BSkyB to broadcast up to 150 channels simultaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A digital broadcast adds greatly to the quality of the picture and allows the viewer to watch a wide-screen TV that can also take a sidebar of different programmes. So, while watching the football, you may also keep an eye on the news or another match - all of which makes it the perfect advance for the Age of Distraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more important point is that a digital broadcast does not have to go through a satellite. It may be received by a conventional aerial and TV set, provided the viewer has a device known as a set-top box to convert the digital information into sound and pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is where Murdoch comes in and where everyone gets confused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BSkyB has announced that it will launch a digital service next year and for this a special set-top box will be designed and marketed. Murdoch's box will be tailored to do two things: decompress the stream of digital information and then decode it. After all, this is a subscription service and, like the present signal from Sky, will be broadcast in code so that only those who have paid will be able to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parallel to Murdoch's activity are the plans by Britain's established broadcasters - the BBC channels, ITV stations and Channel 4 - to develop digital broadcasting. Remember, the digital signal may be conventionally transmitted from a terrestrial station and all that is needed by the viewer is a set-top box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble is that Murdoch has already put out tenders for the design and manufacture of his own box. It will be on the market well before any equivalent device can be agreed upon by the terrestrial broadcasters. This is the crucial advantage he has seized. For it is highly unlikely that the British market will accept two separate boxes for the satellite and terrestrial digital services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point about these boxes is that their manufacture is costly and requires guaranteed orders. While Murdoch has the commercial drive to back the manufacture of his box with orders, the terrestrial broadcasters don't.  They are waiting to see what his box looks like and whether it can be adapted to take terrestrial digital signals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murdoch naturally got the point of all this long before anyone else. In effect, he has set up what is known in the trade as the &quot;gateway&quot; to digital services. For a period his gateway will be the sole means of access to the new TV technology. Even the BBC and ITV companies have come to recognise that they must dance to his tune, although they continue to insist that the development of the alternative terrestrial service will go ahead and that arrangements will be made to manufacture their own device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it would seem that you have a simple race between the satellite and terrestrial delivery digital systems in which Murdoch has a head start. But it is not nearly as simple as that because the BBC and the biggest ITV company - Granada - have signed up to be among the 150 services offered on Murdoch's satellite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an extraordinary development. After all, Murdoch threw the BBC off his Star satellite in Asia as it was offending the Chinese government. But now, in a display of corporate forgiveness or forgetfulness, the BBC plans to entrust all its services to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important is that if BBC and Granada go on the BSkyB satellite, there is a considerably reduced incentive for them to establish a terrestrial service which competes with Murdoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all very odd: on the one hand the corporation is co-operating with Murdoch by adding to the value of his service, yet on the other it issues a statement like this: &quot;The first danger is the dominance of the gateway into the home. No one person or group should be able to abuse control of the set- top box to inhibit competition. If the digital age is to fulfil its true potential we need in the UK a unified regulatory framework to ensure open and non-discriminatory access to providers on fair financial terms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One has the impression of the establishment discreetly waving Murdoch through. It is an impression shared in the City. &quot;There have been rumours,&quot; said a media analyst, &quot;that he has contacted both main parties ... rumours of him having lunch with Michael Heseltine and the other side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly he has talked to Labour's leader, Tony Blair, on aspects of his media interests. If the Labour leader is prepared to be accommodating on the ownership of newspapers by a foreign national, there is no reason why he would object to the advantages Murdoch is taking for himself in digital TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same is true of the Conservative party, which is persuaded by the argument that Murdoch has taken huge risks in the launch of satellite TV and is due an initial period of protected growth. With an election imminent, it would be crazy for either main party to take on Murdoch now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulation on the design of the box has come in the form of a statutory instrument, which has been drafted by the Department of Trade and Industry and will be enforced by Oftel, the regulatory body for television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oftel may also like to look at British Telecom's (BT) relationship with Murdoch. BT's interest in Murdoch's set-top box is to do with the huge amount of telephone traffic that digital broadcasting is expected to generate from people interacting with their TVs. Within five years or so we will be able to summon videos and purchase things we see on TV. Our orders will be made along a telephone line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, the established terrestrial broadcasters have done no such deal, which means this BT facility will add to the value of Murdoch's service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The box is important but in some ways it is a distraction, and it seems certain that Murdoch has realised this. What matters to him is launching first with a range of appealing programmes. The main sales drive will be made by sporting rights and movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is remarkable how the cards seem to fall so well for him. But there again Murdoch has the genius and aggression to think through likely developments, then act on his conclusions. He is also adaptable. Five years ago, he thought movies would do the trick, but then he realised sport was bringing in far more viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sport is what will make Murdoch the de facto gatekeeper. That is the only thing you need to understand about the launch of digital TV by Sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murdoch has sensed that there isn't the political will to contain his power.  He has discovered worldwide that governments will drop their objections for short-term political advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murdoch said last July: &quot;When you are the monopoly distributor you are inclined to dictate.&quot; The Americans are beginning to get the picture that in the age of information it is the means of distribution, not supply, that call the shots. Viacom's chairman, Sumner Redstone, who had been forced to sell an interest in one of his companies to Murdoch in order to get it on to BSkyB, said: &quot;Rupert wants to rule the world and he seems to be doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present he has more than 30% of the British newspaper market and he is likely to achieve a 25% penetration of the satellite digital broadcasting market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Claire Gebhardt-Mann, executive editor of Business Report, will leave the Independent Group to take up a senior post at Finance Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gebhardt-Mann was made the offer by Nigel Bruce and will be a departmental editor. &quot;I have never been in magazines before and it will be a challenge and good learning opportunity,&quot; she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A seasoned journalist, she has been economics editor, news editor and finally executive editor at Business Report. Sources close to her say that this is as far up the ladder she is likely to go within the Independent group as an old boys club atmosphere prevails with no females in powerful positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from Peter Bruce, who has taken up the helm at Financial Mail, and Claire Gebhardt-Mann, former Business Report financial news editor John Soderlund has also left the group to study in Pietermaritzburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that Independent's management is battling to find an editor for Business Report. John Spira, deputy editor, is rumoured to be vying for the job. Some say Spira will get the post by default as he has been twice overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC chief executive of operations and satellite Gert Claassen will be leaving the corporation at the end of March. After five-and-a-half-years at the SABC, Claassen says he was &quot;not dismissed&quot; and &quot;leaving was my own decision&quot;. However, sources at the public broadcaster point out that the satellite operation headed by Claassen, Astrasat, has so far proved an expensive dissapointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said one senior management source: &quot;It was his (Claassen's) advice that management relied on and everything blew up in our faces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some senior staffers talk of sabotage taking place at the hands of the old, mainly white Afrikaans guard in an effort to discredit the new black management, arguing that SABC's black management has to take more decisive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eon de Vos has decided to leave his position as managing director of Highveld Stereo. De Vos says his decision follows discussions with Africa on Air (the consortium which includes Primedia Broadcasting). He says there were irreconcilable &quot;philosophical differences&quot; concerning the future of the station between himself and &quot;other management&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other management is believed to be Primedia Broadcasting chief executive officer Stan Katz. There is rumour that Katz and De Vos came near to blows during one heated argument last year. Neither De Vos nor Katz could be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the hearings for commercial radio will begin in Gauteng next week, ructions within the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA is having to wait for a response from the public protector who is currently scrutinising its financial books. Things are not running smoothly for the regulator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thandi Davids, a staffer in the communications department, has been suspended for more than a month without any formal charges being laid against her. Her suspension stemmed from an appearance on SABC television news where she allegedly placed the IBA in disrepute. Davids will be meeting with her lawyers later this month to consider whether to take the IBA to court for unfair labour practice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Until fairly recently, black magazines were treated by publishers and advertisers as a Cinderella medium. There was little or no investment in the titles &quot;as brands&quot; or in the editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the paper the magazines were printed on was inferior to that used for white magazines. An argument countering this was that black magazines ran at losses, hence justifying publishing inferior products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, the circulation of black magazines stood at 767 998, but this dropped dramatically to 557 860 (total category) in 1993 (-29%). This may have led to a re- assessment in the market which allowed for improved investment in black products through the publishing of better quality magazines, thus engendering a culture of reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the investments which took place was the relaunch of Drum, based on the same editorial formula as its sister publications - Huisgenoot and You.  Suffice to say it has been a success with Drum's circulation increasing from a low of 80 210 in 1993 to +220 000 as a monthly. Now that it is a weekly, the circulation is averaging 140 000 per week (which, if we translate into a monthly figure, equals 560 000). All this, and despite Republican Press's feeble attempt to counter Drum going weekly by launching Next, which is achieving weekly sales of +52 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current projections are that Drum will overtake Huisgenoot as the biggest circulation magazine in the future. However, how many of You's 508 000 black readers have shifted allegiance to Drum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another investment was the re-launch of True Love with Khanyi Dlomo-Mkhize at the helm. True Love has increased circulation from a low of 51 646 to more than 80 000 a month. The appointment of a high-profile editor has enabled True Love to transcend the polarisation of sophistication levels in the black market. True Love and Tribute have a good combination of both sophisticated and less sophisticated readers unlike most of the other black publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebony, with its strong American editorial, was launched in 1995 and has a circulation of 51 732 despite promising the industry circulation of 100 000.  However, the American editorial slant has been dramatically toned down to accommodate a more South African flavour. It will be interesting to see if this editorial shift increases circulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With growth in magazines clearly coming from the black market, according to the latest All Media and Product Survey it should only be a matter of time before we see other publishers follow suit by investing in their titles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market penetration of &quot;read any magazine&quot; increased to 25,8% from 21,4%.  The July to December 1995 total category circulation has increased to 730 270 (based on the assumption that Pace sold 100 000), showing that this category of magazines has growth potential if the product is right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lyndall Campher, Hunt Lascaris group media director, will give a fortnightly analysis of print media circulation, alternating with M&amp;G media editor Jacquie Golding-Duffy's look at television ratings</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Two key media figures are at each other's throats prior to the truth commission's probe into the press, writes Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freedom of Expression Institute and its chair, Raymond Louw, have come under fire for volunteering to assist the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in its investigation of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Editors Forum (BEF), while welcoming an investigation in to the media by the TRC, criticised the process involving the Freedom of Expression Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its statement the BEF says an intermediary such as the institute is unnecessary and would only &quot;serve to sanitise and distort&quot; evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEF and South African National Editors' Forum chair and Enterprise magazine editor- in-chief Thami Mazwai said this week that it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; for Louw or his organisation to oversee the investigation, just as it would be unfavourable for former or current black journalists and their organisations to volunteer to co-ordinate such an important process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the people at the Freedom of Expression Institute were active in the English press during the apartheid years and at no stage did they actively oppose apartheid, which makes them accessories to the various crimes committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To have some of these people heading an investigation where we want other collaborators to come forward and confess their role is ludicrous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Journalists cannot conduct preliminary investigations into themselves as this flies in the face of justice, democracy and pure logic. The TRC has got the skills and the manpower to do the job without an intermediary body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai says he finds it &quot;ridiculous&quot; that the institute is raising funds and claiming to be helping the TRC gather information on the media. &quot;When an investigation as important as this is given to an organisation with no finances then the TRC is certainly not taking this seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BEF in its statement also says a minor industry could be spawned if intermediary bodies are allowed to go around and ask for donations under the guise of the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is absolute rubbish. There is no industry that will be spawned from this,&quot; countered Louw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louw challenged Mazwai, accusing him of possibly wanting to delay the probe into the media. &quot;Why is he (Mazwai) delaying it? Is he trying to prevent an inquiry from taking place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Louw accused Mazwai of delaying tactics, the latter attacked Louw's involvement as &quot;smacking of a jobs-for-pals scenario&quot; which could discredit the attempt to scrutinise the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louw countered that this was &quot;outrageous and not worthy of comment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does he (Mazwai) keep harping on the same tired old theme when we have tried to explain to him that our role is no different from being employed by the TRC to investigate the medical or judicial systems. We are merely co- ordinating the investigation and will not be directly involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be employing researchers to do most of the work with some Freedom of Expression Institute executive members involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board members, pointed out Louw, were a diverse group with several experienced black and white media commentators on board, including one BEF member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louw argues that an &quot;unfortunate impression&quot; would have been created had the TRC,with its state employees, done its own investigation as this would have been construed as the state intervening in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is why the TRC decided it will be appropriate to have an independent body such as ours conduct a preliminary investigation. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC deputy chair Dr Alex Boraine says the TRC was &quot;grateful&quot; when the offer was made by the institute because of the huge amount of work it already has.  However, Boraine says the commission will be reconsidering the whole matter at the next human rights violations meeting, to be held on January 23, as a result of the BEF's official objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having received objections came as a complete surprise and our main concern is that there should be no one group that prevents other voices from being heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggestion that a special week-long hearing be held on the role of the media was proposed by journalist, Human Rights Committee member and truth commission employee Hugh Lewin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal hopes to highlight the possible role the media played in creating and sustaining a climate where gross human violations occurred between 1960 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former political prisoner, Lewin approached the institute to make a recommendation on the appropriateness of the TRC holding hearings at which the role of the media would be scrutinised. Following on this, the TRC suggested ways in which an investigation could be done and the areas that should be focused on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai, however, argues that the selection process for the TRC took more than six months as government wanted to ensure a selection of people which would contribute towards reconciliation while the institute's involvement did not undergo any selection process, stirring possible division.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Madagascar, former colony and popular tourist destination, is close to an epidemic of the Black Death - 187 cases have been diagnosed in one city, after the collapse of organised rubbish collection was followed by a plague of rats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1960s, Madagascar was a confident country with a burgeoning middle- class intent on improvements. Now, only 23% have access to safe water and Madagascar's international debt runs at $340 per person, one-and-a-half times the gross national product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank does not think that Madagascar is even a particularly critical country, but its international debt and decline are typical of the growing gulf between the first and third world. Many African countries now return three times as much in debt repayment to the West than they receive in aid. Others spend four times more repaying international financiers than they do on health. These debts have led to destabilisation, conflict, disease and collapse. Some countries, like Zambia, have reverted to subsistence economies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From this perspective, the millennium has a sense of foreboding rather than anticipation, and widening inequalities suggest an impending disaster.  So I was surprised when I stumbled on one campaign which, with simplicity, uses the idea of the millennium to address global reality. The Jubilee 2000 campaign in Britain wants the millennium to be celebrated by the cancellation of the unpayable debts of the world's poorest countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jubilee 2000 is hosted by the charity Christian Aid and supported by a wide range of church people - evangelicals, Catholics and Anglicans. Outside the church this campaign is virtually unknown, which is hardly surprising. After years of divisiveness, introspection and reactionary politics, few expect the church to take any initiative, let alone an important one. There is a danger the campaign could be used to evangelise about the &quot;truth&quot; of the Bible - the origin of the Jubilee idea of cancelling debts and freeing slaves. But the idea of wiping the slate clean has larger resonance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many aid agencies have long argued for ending third world debt. Oxfam, for example, has campaigned for debt relief for 10 years and regards 1996 as a victorious year, since in September, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank acknowledged that certain countries had &quot;unsustainable&quot; levels of debt, and agreed to a framework for debt reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this victory seems hollow. To qualify for debt reduction, countries have to undertake &quot;structural adjustments&quot; - the usual IMF combination of devalued currency, increased interest rates, cuts in government spending and an end to subsidies to local producers. Measures are required to regulate chaotic economies, but these remedies are inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basic infrastructure is in ruins and needs government spending before a private sector can develop. Existing production is concentrated in the primary sector, where prices are so low in the world market that any free trade charter only favours already rich nations. The IMF-World Bank agreement also contains a Catch 22. Some countries will take six years to qualify: how can they survive that long if their level of debt is now unsustainable?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Ann Pettifor of Jubilee 2000 points out, these countries are declaring themselves bankrupt, and the IMF and World Bank are operating as both creditors and receivers. When countries go bankrupt, there is no insolvency procedure. If creditors propose solutions that in the long run benefit not the poor producers but the protected trade of the West, the downward spiral continues. (This sounds paranoid, but their solutions do not have an impressive record. Rwanda's plight can be traced back to a disastrous IMF intervention after a 1989 collapse in the price of coffee, its key export.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hardly surprising, then, that Jubilee 2000's objectives seem idealistic. Outright cancellation of debts might pander to regimes that borrowed to spend money on arms, or support chaotic economies; it does not solve long-term problems of unfair trade. But all these would be outweighed by the constructive nature of cancelling the debt; it is a step towards a better future and other proposals to celebrate the millennium are parochial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Peace has not brought prosperity to Mozambique. Four years after the end of the civil war, the poorest country in the world is growing poorer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason is that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has ruled that annual inflation must be brought below 15%t before there can be significant post-war reconstruction. This policy is called &quot;stabilisation&quot;, but the former finance minister, Magid Osman, warns: &quot;Putting stabilisation first makes instability more likely.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaying reconstruction is the opposite of the successful policies of Europe and Asia in the 1940s, after the World War II. But the IMF is taking a narrowly monetarist line, arguing that the already minimal level of demand must be further reduced to bring down inflation before investment can be allowed to increase supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique was a cold war battlefield: the decade-long conflict killed a million people and caused damage in excess of $25,3-billion. The war ended with a peace accord in 1992 and highly praised multi- party elections in October 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors want to help Mozambique rebuild, but the IMF has insisted that donors spend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$190-million less this year than in 1994 on reconstruction, which it regards as inflationary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears are growing that people will see no gains from peace and democracy. &quot; If the government does not renegotiate its accord with the IMF, peace is threatened,&quot; warns Pedro Chibala, an official of Sintract, the independent drivers' union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year there was good rainfall and a record maize crop. The 1,7-million returned refugees look forward to earning their first big cash surplus. But piles of maize remain unsold: thousands of tons will rot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roads remain closed because the IMF has forced the government, donor nations and the World Bank to cut back on road repairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMF policy has now been in force for more than five years, but is a manifest failure, even in the organisation's own terms. In the late 1980s, at the height of the war, Mozambique imposed its own modified adjustment policy, which led to significant growth and falling inflation. By 1991, gross national product (GNP) per capita had risen to $115 and inflation had fallen to 21%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That year the IMF imposed its stabilisation policy. Each year since then, GNP per capita has fallen. Mozambique now has a per capita GNP of $100, the lowest in the world, according to the United Nation's 1996 Human Development Report. Industrial production rose in the late 1980s - during the war - but has fallen each year since stabilisation was imposed and is now half of the 1990 level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic Bishop of Nampula, Dom Manuel Vieira Pinto, says that &quot;the IMF must stop looking only at its computers and look at real people in Mozambique&quot; . And he asks: &quot;Will this all end violently?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Eastern Cape may have a lot of natural riches, but maladministration makes it a holiday in hell, writes Aspasia Karras</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minutes of a staff meeting at the Dwesa nature reserve provide ample proof of the extent of the Eastern Cape's shambolic state. The final meeting of 1996, which began at 8.30 on a Friday morning, started by asking all drunk members of staff to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A task team appointed last year by Minister of Public Service and Administration Dr Zola Skweyiya to identify management failures in provincial administrations has yet to report its findings, but if the Eastern Cape is any measure, the problems are indeed huge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwesa, situated in some of the most sublime forest and coast land south of Port St Johns, and administered by the Eastern Cape Department of Conservation, confirms the impression of a province in chaos. Not only has it inherited the critical weaknesses of the homeland administrations, but it has failed to recognise its greatest economic potential, tourism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no denying that physical beauty is the Eastern Cape's most viable asset. If one is prepared to disregard the potential attacks on tourists, the most recent example leaving two British daredevils liberated from both their motor vehicle and their clothes, the province is indeed a world in one oyster, as the recent media campaigns of the provincial government claim. The administration seems to have faith in the potential of its natural resources, but apart from slick campaigning to lure the tourists, it is doing very little to ensure it can actually deliver on its promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the concept became an executive political priority only in April last year when tourism was added to the portfolio of the MEC for Economic Affairs and Environment, Smuts Ngonyama. But neither the MEC, nor his representative, was available for comment at the time of publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My particular experience is enlightening. In February last year, I was told by the Eastern Cape Department of Conservation, which co-ordinates bookings in the reserves along the Wild Coast, that all the facilities were already booked up for December. An unlikely story. I found an ex- civil servant who had gone private, forming Wild Coast Reservations to bridge the gap, doing what she used to do for the Transkei administration. She repeated the fully- booked line, but after insistent requests booked me two cottages at Dwesa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We set out in December, making a stop in Umtata to pick up the permit. Not surprisingly, the person with whom we had made an appointment to collect the permits had arrived at work that morning, and promptly left for the day, destination unknown. In the gloom of the Umtata offices (half the lighting was out of order) we battled for assistance. A chance encounter with the reserve manager, stationed in Umtata, saw us finally on our way, permits in hand. As an aside we were informed that the Umtata office could not communicate with Dwesa as the radio connection had broken years ago, and had never been repaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a harrowing drive on a bad dirt road, and confusion at dissembling signposts, we finally arrived at the gate only to have the guard disappear without explanation, but with our permits, for half-an-hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first thing we noticed was that all the cottages bar two were empty; four of the eight remained empty for the 10 days of our stay, despite their fully-booked status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hike in the reserve proved another headache. The rules and regulations (which were all-pervasive and obscure) demand that a guide accompany all hikers, and we naturally attempted to engage the services of one. The office was a model of administrative incompetence. The guide was unavailable the next day as a result of the end-of-year staff meeting, the following day because it was raining, and the day after he had to physically collect his pay cheque from Umtata - a full four hours away. He was never seen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our travails did not end there. Laundry came back dirtier than before, gas stoves regularly started small domestic fires, and a board in the rickety balcony broke. All encounters with the 200-odd staff (half of whom are a model of labour-intensive grass- cutting projects) at Dwesa were frustrating in the extreme. The rules and regulations prevented anyone from making any decisions of any magnitude whatever. Even the positioning of the firebreaks had to be decided at head office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a case study of bureaucratic incompetence, the Eastern Cape tourism fiasco is a useful starting-point for debates about rule-driven organisations, weak administrations, demotivation, lack of training and human resources, and poor service delivery, which characterise weak governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could even be argued that there is a causal link between the quality of an administration and political stability. But the bottom line is that it is a tragic case of the emperor's new clothes, as the British tourists so obviously discovered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While most clothing companies look to the government to help them promote exports, a Cape Town company is relying on its quality products and the weaker rand to boost export earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pals Holdings Limited has ploughed millions of rand into new equipment and staff training in recent years to improve productivity, and to provide better and more consistent quality and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, it has refrained from joining the chorus of despair about plans to phase out the general export incentive scheme (Geis) and relied instead on the continued weakening of the rand against the British pound to increase export earnings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest annual report, chairman Selwyn Kagan said that critics who said the clothing exporters would not be able to survive without Geis had got it completely wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The depreciating rand will open more opportunities for exports with high added- value production, such as men's and ladies' outerwear,&quot; Kagan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BoE NatWest Securities analyst Syd Vianello agreed: &quot;The only way that you make money out of exports is to have value-added production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the companies had been paid in sterling, which had moved from a rate of R5,70 in September 1995 to around R7,90 now, their returns would have &quot; increased dramatically&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish more were moving into high value- added, but they are not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This message has been coming through very strongly from the Department of Trade and Industry in the past few years, but the industry still generally continues to call for more and better cash incentives from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernard Richards, Clothing Federation of South Africa chairman and managing director of Seardel Investment, urged the government in November to implement a wide range of promised export incentives which he claimed could double clothing exports in two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the so-called &quot;supply-side&quot; measures concentrate on training and improving productivity rather than the tax- based incentives most companies would prefer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vianello said it was highly unlikely that tax-based incentives would ever be offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (the government) are saying: the currency is where you will make your money. The currency will fall to a level where your exports become competitive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kagan has no problem with this line of argument, but he still wishes the government could provide some better incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with the present incentives is that they are linked to training and productivity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to become competitive worldwide as an industry. In order to do that, we need the right equipment and labour force. The equipment is only a matter of money. The labour force is another thing altogether. It is all very well to say that we are going to train people, but it is very difficult to instil a work ethic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kagan said the work ethic in South Africa did not compare well with that of its major competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the existing supply-side export incentives were also cumbersome and &quot;you have to wait too long to get them&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite the gold price hitting a three-year low, Anglogold chair Bobby Godsell tells Max Gebhardt that he is upbeat about the mining industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when negative sentiment is ruling the market, there is a strange, yet welcome sense of optimism at Anglo American's gold and uranium division in its Main Street headquarters in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gold might be hitting three-year lows, at one stage trading at $358 this week - its lowest level since October 1993 - but says Anglogold chair Bobby Godsell with a laugh, his tenure of 18 months has been fun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Godsell says he isn't full of gloom and doom for 1997, though Anglogold did adopt what he calls rather conservative figures for its 1997 gold price projections. This latest slump hasn't even reached the bottom end of its figures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think people should overact, this is seasonally a bad time for physical demand for gold, particularly Asian demand,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Godsell, Anglogold had been expecting the gold price to trade around the $360 level, but he is not willing to be drawn into the game of predicting the price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will run our mines profitably pretty much whatever the gold price is - the variation will be how much we produce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of Godsell's appointment in late 1995, analysts and some press reports maintained the gold industry - and Anglogold in particular - were on the &quot;skids&quot;. The industry had been facing spiralling costs that saw South African gold mines collectively move in the mid- 1980s from the lowest to highest cost producers internationally. The mines have also been facing a two- headed monster as production and productivity started falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the mines underwent a major cost-cutting drive in the early 1990s, which gave them some respite, according to Godsell. But this was to be short-lived as margins have come under increased pressure once again and the margin squeeze hit a century low in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to tackle some of these problems, Anglogold decided to focus on three core strategies to lead into the next century. These included becoming globally competitive, developing the potential &quot;blue skies&quot; (new operations) of the mines and to ensure wealth creation by continued gold mining operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gold grade and the price are rightly, as Godsell points out, in the hands of God on the one hand and the market on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we can control is the cost per kilogram and we can change that through good management, new technologies and increased productivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since labour costs account for roughly 50% of working costs, the major challenge for 1997, Godsell believes, will be to make real breakthroughs on the labour productivity front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have made a start by signing an important agreement with the National Union of Mineworkers and other unions, which concluded that productivity increases are vital to the industry and all aspects of the work practices needed to be reviewed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties recognised that unless operational inefficiencies can be addressed, closing margins between costs and revenue would remain a constant threat to employment in the mines. They therefore gave themselves a six-month timeframe in which to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already Vaalreefs is seeing the benefits of these agreements and has reached a working calendar for 1997 that will see a further 25 shifts come into play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our goal in 1997 is to reduce unit labour costs; in fact, we have active plans in our 1997 budget to reduce unit labour costs,&quot; says Godsell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we can't control our revenue we have to control our costs; otherwise we will have to close mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the mining houses attempt to bring these costs under control, many have begun unbundling and cancelling their management contracts with the mines.  Anglogold has been reluctant to follow this route, even under criticism from industry analysts. Godsell says Anglogold remains committed to the belief in the mining finance house because of its historical and economic advantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are reviewing the relationship between the mines and the mining finance house to make sure that it is an appropriate and fair relationship and collective services are paid for at market value,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This review should be completed fairly soon, he adds, and Anglogold is committed to informing its shareholders if there is any change in policy. But Godsell says he can't see anything magical in any unbundling exercise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The privatisation of Sun Air is galloping ahead, with the Transport Department set to interview on Friday advisers who will start work on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortlist of three possible advisers for the R200-million airline sale comprises banking group Investec, a partnership between investment bank BoE NatWest and Johannesburg law firm Moseneke &amp; Partners, and Real Africa Durolink, the investment banking arm of Don Ncube's Real Africa Investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transport Department advertised for advisers over the Christmas break.  Industry observers say transport director general Ketso Gordhan's appointment of advisers for the Sun Air privatisation has been rapid and efficient. This stands in contrast to the Public Enterprises Department's efforts to appoint its advisers last year - a painfully protracted process subject to many delays before Simpson McKie HSBC, a tie up between the local stockbroker and international banking group HSBC, was finally selected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advisers have been told they will work with Simpson McKie HSBC, the overall government adviser. However, the overlap between advisers working for Minister of Transport Mac Maharaj and those working for Minister of Public Enterprises Stella Sigcau comes after long-standing tensions between the two ministers over who should control the privatisation of state transport assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks and advisers hired by online ministers will execute the actual sales. All ministries with state assets earmarked for privatisation in their portfolios are entitled to hire their own advisers, as are parastatal heads themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sigcau indicated last year that the government wanted to see Sun Air sold off in the first half of this year. Gordhan could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wandile Zote, a Public Enterprises representative, said that according to the Department of Transport an announcement on the winning adviser would be made on Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin Atlantic, which last year entered into a partnership deal with Sun Air, whereby the local carrier now handles Virgin's connecting South African flights, has expressed interest in buying the airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maharaj reportedly said last year he would prefer to see Sun Air bought by a local group. He said: &quot;I would like a South African investor or consortium to buy it, but I would check carefully to ensure it isn't a front for a large foreign airline such as British Airways or Singapore Airlines. That would give them a strategic foothold here and enable them to undercut South African Airways.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Regional and developmental issues top South Africa's agenda in the next round of EU negotiations, writes Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After frequent setbacks, the next round of talks between South Africa and the European Union over a trade deal will kick off on January 22. This time, the departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry, jointly leading the negotiations, will put regional development issues top of the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria's position paper, informally presented to Brussels last month, made plain South Africa's priorities. While short on detail, it made regional and developmental concerns a priority. Indeed, Pretoria is hoping that the new discussions will open the way for a trade and development agreement (TDA) rather than merely a free trade agreement (FTA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's first mandate failed to consider the importance of the region to South Africa, economically as well as politically, says an insider. &quot;The fact that we have embarked on a rapid tariff- lowering programme, far exceeding the demands of the World Trade Organisation, is proof enough of our commitment to the region. It is time the EU understood that,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the EU is trying to work out a framework for a new Lome agreement due in 1998, and South Africa's role within it. A trade deal that incorporates developmental concerns, with South Africa accepting an asymmetric arrangement in return for EU compensation to our regional partners, could provide the model for a post-Lome IV pact, says Dr Garth le Pere, executive director of the Foundation for Global Dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far in the negotiations, the emphasis has been on trade, with agriculture the biggest hiccup to their progress, but the developmental considerations are just as important, he says. At a recent workshop hosted by the FGD, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) made clear its desire for a developmental component to any deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of South Africa's comparative advantage in terms of manufacturing production, it would make sense if our regional neighbours concentrated on agriculture, with free access to the EU market in terms of Lome. Such an arrangement might include EU infrastructural and technical assistance to the region, while South Africa benefits from increased manufacturing penetration to the EU states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all this assumes a satisfactory solution to the South African Customs Union (Sacu) negotiations, expected to be finalised soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faizel Ismail, chief director of foreign trade relations at the DTI, stressed the importance of a cohesive policy, taking into account the economic differences. &quot;We need greater co-ordination,&quot; he says, &quot;otherwise we could end up competing for investment, which would be playing a zero- sum game. In addition, whatever policy is devised, we have to ensure it is implemented more efficiently than in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stumbling block is revenue sharing, with some members, such as Lesotho, reliant on the Sacu pool for 70% of its total receipts, while others, such as Swaziland and Namibia are less dependent, at 54%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The objective is to devise an equitable and sustainable formula without placing undue pressure on South Africa's fiscus. We had to work out the internal flows of trade to calculate the revenue pool but a formula has been agreed and guidelines have been set, so we are optimistic a deal can be struck soon,&quot; says Ismail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tariff levels are another important aspect of the negotiations, and again, Sacu had to be incorporated into any deal with the EU. &quot;We are confident the EU better appreciates our position vis-a-vis Sacu now. Growth must be seen as a regional issue, not just a South African priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matandele, Zimbabwe - Surrounded by government ministers and tribal chiefs, Sinqobile Mabhena appears a model of female subservience as she bows her head and modestly lowers her eyes. But this demure 23-year-old has rocked Zimbabwe's traditional culture by becoming one of the first women to take on the powerful mantle of tribal chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know many people are opposed to me becoming chief because I am a woman,&quot; said Mabhena. &quot;I will prove to them that I can work as much as a man. Being a woman doesn't mean you are disabled.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabhena was installed last month as chief of the estimated 100 000 people of the Nswazi communal area in southern Zimbabwe. The ceremony featured dashing Ndebele warriors in leopard skin loincloths, old women in bone necklaces intoning the spirits of their ancestors, several choirs, drumming and, of course, a feast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bring your community a Christmas present, your new chief, Sinqobile Mabhena,&quot; said Zimbabwe's minister for local Government John Nkomo to ululations and cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chief Howard Mabhena died in 1993 and he had no son to succeed him. It therefore fell upon his eldest daughter, Sinqobile, to succeed him and she has taken up her chieftainship responsibilities with humility,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that Mabhena's investiture had been delayed by more than a year because of objections. &quot;The government held lengthy discussions and the Nswazi people insisted they would rather have Sinqobile than a male chief who would not have been appointed by them. All's well that ends well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chief's main responsibilities are to preside over hearings to settle family disputes and matters of property. &quot;I want to look at all sides in any dispute and to be fair,&quot; said Mabhena. &quot;I don't want to only take the woman's side or to just take the man's side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well-wishers crowded round to congratulate Mabhena, she wiped tears from her eyes. &quot;I just thought about this whole thing, the history, my father, the future, the responsibility, everything,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the week Mabhena lives in Bulawayo, where she is studying to be a primary schoolteacher. She wears short skirts, high heels and has a boyfriend, who is a schoolteacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At weekends she goes back to her family's rural home where she meets in council with the Mabhena clan's elders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five other chiefs witnessed the event, as well as the governor of Matabeleland South province and the local MP. Her investiture, however, does not bring an end to the controversy. The ceremony was boycotted by several chiefs and political figures, and the attendance of 800 was smaller than the 2 000 that had been anticipated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mabhena's grandmother, Gogo Flora Masuku, is outspokenly in favour. &quot;I am very, very happy to see a female chief. Women must stand up for their rights and advance their position. Women fought to end Rhodesia. We now have female Cabinet ministers and aeroplane pilots. Why not chiefs? Is the queen of Britain a man? Women can be leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Opio had the misfortune to be caught by the rebels as he rode his bike to market with his son and small daughter. &quot;You know that it's forbidden to ride bikes,&quot; they screamed at him. They tied him up before cutting off his foot with a panga. Then they smashed his bicycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without my leg, it's like I'm dead,&quot; he told journalists from his hospital bed in Lachor, a missionary hospital just outside Gulu town, the regional capital of Gulu district and the centre of LRA activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels attack villagers with bikes on the dubious grounds that they would otherwise escape quickly, cycle to town and warn the Ugandan Army when the LRA is around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kony's ragtag army follows other strange practices. They used to slice the lips, ears or arms off their victims. Then they turned on anyone owning white chickens. Then it was the owners of white pigs who were killed. They also say villagers should not travel on the &quot;holy days&quot; of Friday and Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the rebels progressed to buttock- slashing, although doctors say villagers are now just as likely to be injured by landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kony, their leader, is a 35-year-old former catechist who has been fighting for 10 years to overthrow the government of President Yoweri Museveni and put in its place an administration based on the 10 Commandments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group was born in 1988 out of the remnants of the Holy Spirit movement, led by Kony's aunt, &quot;priestess&quot; Alice Lakwena. She believed that stones thrown by the faithful would explode like grenades and that shea-nut oil smeared on her hymn- singing fighters would deflect enemy bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LRA may not have a clear political agenda, but it has had a huge impact.  The north-south divide was reflected in last year's presidential election, which saw an overwhelming victory for Museveni nationwide, but a landslide success for his main opponent in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all the region's schools and health centres have been closed. Most roads are impassable because of the threat of ambushes and landmines. More than 130 000 people are displaced in Gulu district alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels have successfully eluded the Ugandan Army and survived with little civilian support, instead terrorising the population into acquiescence.  Most Acholi, the northern tribe affected by the insurgency, say they are caught between the LRA's violence and the Ugandan military's incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a minority of Acholi join the rebels freely. Most LRA recruits are kidnapped children. The United Nations Children's Fund estimates that 3 000 have been taken in the past two years alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, the LRA led four major attacks on schools. Among those abducted were 109 girls from Aboke College, later rescued when an Italian nun followed the rebels and offered her life for the girls' release. Thirty girls, however, were retained for their beauty and remain in captivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After training, recruits are either taken back to Uganda or made to fight the southern Sudanese rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, a task that former rebels say they undertake in exchange for arms from the Sudan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the children grow used to the rebel life. Witnesses to LRA attacks say that the rebels aged between 12 and 14 are the most terrifying. But most are bound to the LRA through fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David (15) escaped after two years in captivity: &quot;The commanders want to fight, but the rest are like me and would run away if they could. If you do escape and they capture you, the commanders beat you or kill you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands, however, escape. Until recently former rebels were handed over to the army. When the numbers became overwhelming, the World Vision aid agency took over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Kirandongo Trauma Counselling Centre, about 120km south of Gulu town, former rebels kick a football around a huge pitch, while small groups study tailoring outside grass huts. The mood is amiable, although fights sometimes break out. &quot;We had one intake who accused another group at the centre of abducting them,&quot; said trauma counsellor Aldo Achen. &quot;We try to teach them that they have all committed crimes and, but for the presidential amnesty, are all capable of being charged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Vision has treated more than 1 300 former rebels. &quot;Most have bad memories,&quot; Achen said. &quot;One girl had cut bodies into parts. She said it became automatic. Another girl beat the heads of captives until they were flat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite disruption to life in northern Uganda, the military say the situation is beginning to improve. However, the LRA, the bulk of which recently returned to Sudan, remains undefeated despite a huge deployment of government troops, an army reshuffle and Museveni's October relocation to Gulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many northerners believe the only hope lies in negotiation, either with the rebels or with Sudan. But Museveni refuses to talk to the LRA, while mediation efforts last September between Sudan and Uganda came to nothing after Sudan allegedly bombed a northern Ugandan town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Education Ministry is struggling to determine whether its drive to reshape state schooling has achieved much more than lose South Africa thousands of experienced state teachers and unnerve those who remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure is growing on the ministry -even from its own officials - to rethink the programme, which is supposed to redeploy teachers from &quot; overstaffed&quot; state schools to understaffed schools, or offer voluntary retrenchments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry does not know how many, if any, teachers have been redeployed, or how many teachers the provinces have on their books.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nearly 12 000 teachers have been given the voluntary severance package, and another 6 000 teachers have applied for it. Thousands more are expected to apply this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average payout for each is more than R66 000, before pensions, which have landed some with seven-figure handshakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than seven months after the reshape began, ministry officials have started a fresh investigation into teaching resources. The programme will be revised, depending on the findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Director General of Education Dr Ihron Rensburg has also floated the prospect of forced retrenchments - putting the ministry on collision course with the South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) and the National Professional Teachers' Association of South Africa (Naptosa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're heading for a major showdown,&quot; Sadtu general secretary Thulas Nxesi says. &quot;It's chaos. It's being implemented without a clear plan. Provincial departments have not had the right statistics so they don't know where people should be redeployed or how many teachers they've got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not ready to continue the debate on rationalisation. The only solution is to go back to the drawing board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry officials want to meet the unions later this month to find common ground. Nxesi is planning meetings across the country next month for Sadtu's 160 000 members to determine strategy, including strike action. Naptosa's tones are more guarded, but suggest any attempt to cut numbers will be hard fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff shake-up is central to the government's attempts to reallocate teaching resources more equitably between provinces - a process due to run until 2 000. Provinces such as Gauteng and the Western Cape, where schools are judged overstaffed, have suffered heavy budget cuts. Others have had budgets increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry this week said the process was &quot;on track&quot;, class sizes in disadvantaged schools were falling and many promotion posts had been created - KwaZulu-Natal recently advertised around 7 000 such posts. &quot;The large number of requests for voluntary severance packages indicates this was a realistic approach to provide an alternative to redeployment,&quot; it noted in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But deputy director general of human resources Roelf du Preez says the ministry has no profile yet of the teachers taking the voluntary severance package, or of redeployment numbers. The unions say they know of no redeployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Preez says the lack of clarity follows the decision to devolve implementation to the provinces, who devolved it further to individual school right-sizing committees. &quot;The provinces are just busy processing the things,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jimmy and Louise Warner, both 53, are about to start new careers. He will work from their Rondebosch home for Cape estate agents Steer &amp; Co, and she will help with the typing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Eldorado Park, Johannesurg, Anthony Swartz (50) is also starting afresh, going into a business which he doesn't want to talk about yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no great rush to start work. The Warners have a lump sum in their bank account which runs well into seven figures; Swartz is sitting on more than R1-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is their &quot;reward&quot; for leaving the state school system. It is a deal which thousands of state school teachers are buying into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voluntary retrenchment is central to the government's drive to equalise education resources - a plan agreed to with teaching unions last May.  Provinces such as Gauteng and the Western Cape are judged to be over- endowed, so their funds have been cut. The offer to thousands of their teachers is to be redeployed (usually to another province) or to take the money (which includes their pension) and go. Most are taking the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner was a principal, his wife a grade one teacher, and together they had chalked up 50 years' teaching experience before they quit last September.  When Swartz goes at the end of this month, he will have been in the profession for 29 years, the last 11 as a principal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department always expected the severance programme to appeal mainly to senior staff, given their unwillingness to relocate, and the size of their pay-offs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the profession, however, the exodus - in the face of the reshaping, the drive to lift the matric performance and the launch next year of a new curriculum - has set alarm bells ringing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a national tragedy. It has left us with a critical shortage of people with experience at a senior level,&quot; South African Teachers' Association director Mike Reeler says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Democratic Teachers' Union says voluntary severance was only supposed to be a tool to further redeployment. But losing staff now seems to be the Education Department's sole aim. &quot;The packages are running totally counter to what they're supposed to achieve,&quot; national media officer Kate Skinner says. &quot;They were never supposed to be a right, but it seems anyone, even those desperately needed, can get the package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Warners' reasons aren't the same as Swartz's motives. Jimmy Warner was just tired. He had been looking for a way out for three years, and he and his wife were among the first in the queue when the Western Cape, one of the hardest hit by funding cuts, announced its severance programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found myself under a lot of pressure,&quot; Warner says. &quot;The most difficult thing was the attitude of the parents. You can't discipline and run a school unless you've got support from parents. I was always bogged down in silly disciplinary things, wondering who was going to phone next to give me a rocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The package they offered was very attractive. I've got enough years ahead of me to start a new career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the profession since he was 16, Warner spent the last six years as principal at Blouberg Ridge Primary in Table View. The school had less than 100 pupils when he started and close to 600 when he left. Warner recruited and trained the 17 staff, and led fund-raising attempts for books and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no opposition to his severance application and he knows of no one else who was turned down when they asked to leave. Three of Warner's staff took the severance package, and ten of the 40 staff at the nearby Table View primary school also went.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since September about 700 principals from the province's 1 600 schools have gone, many followed by their deputies. In total, the Western Cape had to shed 6 000 teaching staff by the end of last month. Another 6 000 are supposed to go before the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one in their right mind would want to be redeployed,&quot; Warner says, adding that he never had a problem with the department itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swartz's departure, however, stems almost entirely from his problems with the Gauteng Education Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very difficult for us older members of the profession to come to grips with the manner the department conducts itself,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are supposed to give guidance and they can't because their appointments are questionable, they're young and they know nothing. It's very frustrating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His school, Willow Crescent Secondary in Eldorado Park, had 48 staff and 1 100 pupils - a ratio of of 23:1 which prevents the school teaching the full curriculum, he adds. It was still deemed to be overstaffed. Swartz says his school escaped lightly - just he and one other staff member are going. At nearby Coronationville Secondary School, however, the principal, two deputies and most heads of department are leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure government in time will realise they've made a very serious mistake. The profession is losing its most competent and dedicated people, &quot; Swartz says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've made my contribution. I just want to get out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tension is rising between the intelligence services and their parliamentary watchdog, the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, over the government's bungling of the appointment of the country's first inspector general, Louis Skweyiya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As government officials and parliamentarians cast around to find a scapegoat for Skweyiya's premature resignation - before he had even begun the job - the intelligence services are preparing to write a letter to the committee warning its members not to leak confidential information to the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members are privy to government secrets but are under oath not to disclose them to the public. Senior sources in the intelligence services say they suspect a committee member has leaked the details of the Skweyiya debacle, as well as other confidential information, for party political gain, making it impossible for them to manage the salary problems and persuade him to stay in the post.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources say the intelligence services, which fall under the Ministry of Justice, had hoped to repair the damage caused by the clumsy salary negotiations and persuade Skweyiya to withdraw his resignation tendered on October 1 last year, four months after he was appointed by President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skweyiya says he will not withdraw his resignation because the matter was disclosed in the media and his appointment was unfairly politicised. Quoting anonymous sources, the media had accused Skweyiya of trying to negotiate a R1- million salary package, an allegation he has vehemently denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skweyiya told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week it was the government's delay in defining his conditions and terms of service which finally led to his resignation. The intelligence services said in a press release final agreement on the package was not reached because the committee had rejected it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An intelligence source said the package had been based on the salary of the public protector but had included an offer to convert a number of perks - such as medical aid contributions and aeroplane flights - into cash to boost the take-home salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee chair, Nosiviwe Mapisa- Nqakula, said this week she was outraged that the intelligence services were implying the committee had snarled up the negotiations. &quot;Whatever hitches there were, they were not brought to our attention. I only heard last week through the media that Skweyiya had resigned. He did not send us a letter informing us he had resigned, and neither did the Ministry of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The committee is being unfairly blamed. We are willing to discuss the issue, but we are not prepared to waste time on it, and we will decide when we meet whether or not we need to start head-hunting again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapisa-Nqakula said more than just salary negotiations had been under way.  Skweyiya had also tried to negotiate for the office of the inspector general to be based in Cape Town, whereas the committee had been convinced he should be based in Pretoria with the intelligence services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The proposed special deal for KwaZulu-Natal is a serious threat to the rule of law, says deputy chair Alex Boraine. Ann Eveleth reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal's &quot;special amnesty&quot; proposal would undermine the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's current amnesty process, promote a culture of impunity and pose a serious threat to the rule of law, the commission's deputy chair, Alex Boraine, said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the proposal, Kwazulu-Natal's warlords, foot soldiers and &quot;third force&quot; operatives would not be required to disclose past crimes but would only have to turn in their weapons, reveal and dismantle their hit squads and participate in the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in his personal capacity as the proposal mooted by African National Congress chair Jacob Zuma last month had not yet been discussed with the commission, Boraine said he told President Nelson Mandela prior to the recent amnesty cut-off extension that &quot;we as the commission would fiercely resist any further extension because it would promote impunity and undermine the rule of law&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I also think this kind of discussion undermines the work of the amnesty committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC insiders, however, confirmed Mandela had given his tentative support to Zuma's &quot;peace package&quot; aimed at ending the province's 14-year civil war at a holiday meeting with the party's provincial leadership at his Qunu home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuma announced plans to push for a further extension of the amnesty cut-off date last month, just after Mandela approved the latest extension. The party's provincial deputy chair, S'bu Ndebele, said the proposal would form part of a broader &quot;peace package&quot; notionally approved by the party's November provincial conference. &quot;The delegates mandated the leadership to work out the details,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele said the package would aim to &quot;lock&quot; all provincial role-players into the peace process initiated in the run-up to the province's June 1996 local government elections. This would include political parties, traditional leaders and &quot;people whose leadership has depended on violence. It is in the context of asking what to do with the warlords that the question of a special amnesty has arisen. We have to make peace compulsory and irreversible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele said the proposal would see the dislosure function of the truth body's amnesty process &quot;altered slightly to mean disclosure of military structures, the handing over of weapons and a commitment to peace&quot;. This commitment would be monitored and further violence would face &quot;the rule of law with the appointment of a super attorney-general&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal truth commissioner Richard Lyster said such a proposal would send &quot;a completely wrong message about what happens when you kill people. It sends a fundamentally bad message about the notion of justice in this province when you have police, magistrates and judges who are pushed aside, and politicians essentially decide whom to prosecute and whom to give amnesty to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zuma's proposal is understood to have gained the support of most provincial ANC leaders who have come to believe the province can &quot;no longer afford to worry about the past&quot;, other sectors say they will oppose anything resembling a general amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC national MP and South African Communist Party deputy chairman Blade Nzimande said he would stongly oppose the measure being imposed in areas like the war-torn KwaZulu- Natal Midlands region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who have suffered and who have lost children, wives and husbands to the violence would not be happy to be the only people in the country who don't know who their murderers are. The widow of (slain Midlands leader) Reggie Hadebe and others in the Midlands would not rest until the truth is known,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress of South African Trade Unions's KwaZulu-Natal chair, John Zikhali, said Cosatu was prepared to accept some special arrangements to promote the peace process, but he added: &quot;We are not going to support it at all costs. Our understanding is we are talking about extending the amnesty deadline for the province and perhaps widening the amnesty conditions to reassure the warlords that the truth will set them free, but this must still entail full public disclosure of their crimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also signs the proposal will face opposition from the ANC's grassroots structures, with some members expressing concern this week that Zuma might hope to present them with a fait accompli as Mandela had done in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is being discussed internally, yet no one is saying openly they are talking about a blanket amnesty. The leadership says they have not discussed it with the Inkatha Freedom Party yet, but IFP public works MEC Celani Mtetwa is always close to Zuma. It was he and Zuma who were talking about a merger last year,&quot; said an ANC activist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng Attorney General Jan d'Oliveira told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week the amnesty proposal would require &quot;a lot of careful thinking. It can't be confined to the ANC and IFP, it would have to apply evenly. Obviously the truth commission already interferes with our work, so any extension would have far-reaching implications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network of Independent Monitors director Jenni Irish said the proposal was rooted in &quot;a false sense of success for the current peace process. Violence is continuing, and now they seem to want to rescue it with a special amnesty that is extremely short- sighted. When does it end? Do we now include the Worcester bombing? It misses the key question of whether it will really end violence which revolves around issues of power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- IFP leader Mangosuthu Buth-ulezi rejected the terms of the ANC proposal this week: &quot;How can we talk of amnesty while the war is going on full swing ..  . We cannot accept ... that those who blindly killed or orchestrated the violence from high-ranking political positions may elude their responsibilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Pragmatism has defeated romance at Villiera Wine Estate just outside Stellenbosch, where wine-maker Jeff Grier has swapped natural corks for synthetic stoppers to seal his cheaper bottles of wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some wine aficionados have decried the move as a tragedy for South African wine drinkers, others are praising Grier for bravery. They are watching carefully how the market will react to the synthetic stoppers, known as corqs, which are already widely used overseas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By introducing the synthetic corqs - which are biodegradable, recyclable and made of a substance safe enough to use as artificial heart valves - Grier hopes to avoid the problems created by poor-quality natural corks, which ruin up to 5% of the country's wines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Natural or bark cork has all the disadvantages of a living thing, like flaws, holes, damaged cells affecting elasticity and the fact that it shrinks over time,&quot; he says. &quot;Natural corks cost the industry a fortune every year in replacing corked bottles and conducting research and tests in an attempt to eliminate the problem. But success is not being achieved and, to make matters worse, the availability of quality cork is under pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially Grier will use the corqs on wines which should be drunk within the next two years, but he also wants to experiment with better-quality wines to see how the &quot;corqed&quot; wine matures over periods up to 10 years. If the synthetic corqs are a success, Grier is thinking of producing them himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grier's neighbour, James Browne, of Hartenberg Wine Estates, says the synthetic corqs are an important innovation. &quot;There have been a number of important court cases by wine estates against cork producers because of poor- quality corks. There is great demand for synthetic corks in England, for example, precisely because of this problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tweejongezellen's wine-maker, Nicky Krone, is in two minds about the corq: &quot; Even if I am one of the last of the romantics, perhaps one should be sensible about this. One will eventually come to associate corqs with the cheaper range.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grier's synthetic corqs come from the United States and cost 70c each.  Natural corks, imported from Portugal and Spain, cost between 45c and R1,10, depending on the length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acclaimed cellar master Achim von Arnim of Haute Cabriere in Franschoek says he does not use synthetic corks and is prepared to pay more for good- quality natural cork. &quot;The cork is part of the maturing process; it discreetly gives air to the wine and allows the wine to mature. But if you are bottling wine to drink next year, I suppose you might as well use crown corks - the sort of corks you use on beer bottles,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The avalanche of sightseers and tourists wanting to visit Robben Island could result in permanent damage to the marine environment on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This warning comes from the island's temporary administrator, Professor Andre Odendaal, and the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront's harbour master Bill Shewell. Odendaal said he was working on a tight schedule to ensure that proper structures were put in place to accommodate the requests from the many visitors wanting to visit the prison where President Nelson Mandela spent 27 years, and where thousands of other political prisoners were kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visitors have been queuing at the Waterfont booking office early every morning, but numbers are currently restricted to 290 a day. Odendaal stressed that this could only be increased once proper structures were in place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Island authorities blockaded the entrance to the island last weekend after four privately operated charter boats defied regulations and allowed an estimated 200 passengers to go ashore. Officials of the Arts and Culture Ministry used buses and taxis to block the entrance to the island village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odendaal said this week that a naval vessel with two personnel was used to prevent further transgressions. According to Odendaal, negotiations are continuing with the police to establish a station on the island to ensure permanent and proper control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took over the temporary administration of the island on January 1. He was appointed by the Ministry of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, which assumed controlling authority of the island from the Department of Correctional Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robben Island is to be run as a site museum, where the total environment is conserved in an integrated way. The prison will be converted into a museum of the freedom struggle in South Africa.Odendaal said initial problems with private boat companies seem to have been resolved after several parties, including the head of the ex-Political Prisoners Committee, Ahmed Kathrada, came out strongly against transgressions on the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Odendaal, Shewell expressed his outrage at the actions of the private boat owners last weekend and added that the Waterfront would do &quot; everything in its power to prevent similar actions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boat Owners' and Charter Association chairman Bruce See said earlier in the week that he was seeking legal advice about the way the government allegedly interfered with private enterprise by preventing more people from visiting the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oddendaal said it is &quot;out of the question&quot; that more visitors could be allowed. He added, however, that when the numbers were eventually increased all ferries operating to the island would be under the control of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. &quot;Our main concern at this stage is to prevent damage to the environment because the establishment of the museum is a long-term project. &quot;Robben Island is a very sensitive area with a large penguin colony and a propensity for bush fires. If the area is disturbed in any way the marine environment could face permanent damage,&quot; said Odendaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shewell said the Waterfront did not want to involve itself further with the running of island ferries. He did, however, express concern over the time- frame in which Odendaal had to complete his task. &quot;I think they have performed wonders since New Year's day, but they are working under tremendous strain.Can you imagine the enormous damage done to the environment if 5 000 people a day are dumped on the island. This is a real possibility if the structures in place now allow that situation to develop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations on the future of the historic departure point on Jetty 1 in the Table Bay harbour situated next to the Waterfront shopping complex were still continuing, according to Shewell. Odendaal disagrees and says all parties concerned have agreed that the site will be preserved in its current state. Marine manager of Portnet John Cosnett said this week that the future of the site was not yet secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that there are several issues still under discussion. We control a large part of Jetty 1 and have made presentations to build another storey on top of the building at the point of departure for ferries to the island. To my knowledge these negotiations are still continuing,&quot; said Cosnett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathrada and other ex-prisoners have, in the past, supported the preservation of the site in its current form, but was this week not willing to comment on the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - National Parks Board CE Robbie Robinson has chosen to retire on a matter that could split the board, reports Anita Allen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imminent departure of Dr Robbie Robinson as chief executive means that the 17-member National Parks Board is going to be put to the test. Not only does it have to choose a successor when there is no recognisable crown prince, but Robinson's request for early retirement on a matter of principle has ensured the whole issue will be played out in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Mail &amp; Guardian this week Robinson insisted that despite his every effort, he appeared to be the only opponent to the appointment of a commercial director, answerable to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As envisaged, this would effectively split commercial and conservation functions throughout the organisation, which would create divisions. It's been tried before and it doesn't work in terms of my philosophy of national parks. After much soul-searching I decided I had no option but to request early retirement,&quot; Robinson said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes he exhausted all avenues open to him and by retiring he has done the right thing for the organisation he has served for 31 years. Sources close to the board this week said Robinson's request for retirement came as a surprise to everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not a politician,&quot; said Robinson. &quot;I don't choose words for political agendas. I'm basically trained in natural science. I believe I'm a competent national parks manager and that's what I do. I realised the board as an organisation can make a lot more money long ago. In the last three years we've shown tremendous increases in profitability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically 1995/96 was an all-time record, with the business unit making a R35-million net profit. This year, we hope for something in excess of a R42- million net profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On a global scale there isn't any national park organisation that gets even close to us. We are now generating 80% of total budget. Second to us is New Zealand with 20%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there was always room for improvement, Robinson said he was happy with the present policy of integrating functions within the organisation where all officials were responsible for generating funds, and drew up strategic plans monitored by the finance department. In addition, the board had a sub-committee tasked with making the organisation more profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of commercialisation was not new, Robinson emphasised, it had been the subject of many workshops. Already various activities had been outsourced and privatised and others were constantly being identified so as to develop entrepreneurial opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crunch point in discussions about restructuring for Robinson came when the finance committee, despite his total opposition, recommended to the board that it appoint a new director of a commercial arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was told we are going to divide the organisation in terms of two activities - commercial and conservation. I was being asked to do something that runs against my whole career. I joined the organisation as an outsider because I believed that a national park has to have a park warden and during the 31 years in the organisation I always maintained that my park wardens represented me in each one of the parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now I was being asked to think about splitting the organisation and to get my senior staff on board. I belaboured this thing and agonised. Imagine, all the commercial people would report to the new director and not in terms of the line management functions we had set up. I'm prepared to outsource and privatise certain functions, but I don't want a director telling all my other directors what to do. It has been tried in so many organisations. Namibia tried it and now they have to privatise completely, we tried it in the 1970s, so did the Natal Parks Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you privatise something in the middle of a national park you annihilate the reason why that area was set out. You want peace and serenity, to observe nature in an unspoiled and unpolluted state. Everything in a national park must be developed in terms of facilitating this appreciation of nature and all employees must subscribe to this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When announcing that it had agreed to Robinson's request for early retirement, the National Parks Board said he was the initiator of transformation and left a solid infrastructure to take the board into the next phase, which was to eliminate discrimination, create career opportunities and link conservation and development with material benefits for surrounding communities bordering on parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The board intends accelerating this, but reaffirms that conservation of biodiversity is sacrosanct,&quot; its statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applications for Robinson's job close next week and three applications have been received so far. Topping the list of probables is Rams Rammutla, present director of Operations: North; Dr Anthony Hall-Martin, present director of research and development, and Dr Salomon Joubert, former warden of Kruger Park.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) has signed an agreement with a foreign conglomerate that contractually obliges it to support the full listing of the commercial rights to some of South Africa's prime environmental assets on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assets include the second-biggest canyon in the world, Blyde River Canyon, South Africa's fifth most popular international tourist attraction, Pilgrim's Rest, other prime natural features, such as Bourkes Luck and Blyde River Potholes, and at least five provincial game reserves.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secret &quot;shareholders' contract&quot; between MPB and the self-proclaimed &quot; multi-billion dollar&quot; conglomerate, Dolphin Group, signed on November 1, binds the MPB to secrecy for the full 50 years that the contract remains in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It grants Dolphin and its subsidiaries, Block Hotels and United Touring Company, the exclusive commercial management and development rights to all but one of MPB's game reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin reserves the right to sell these management contracts later to sub- contractors for its own profit. In return, Dolphin undertakes to fund the MPB's budget deficit over the contract's 50-year term, as well as investing between R300- and R400-million in &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; projects in the parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB insists that it was forced to seek private-sector funding after the provincial government informed the parastatal that it would cease funding in 10 years' time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Dolphin Group has put together a deal that not only includes Mpumalanga's prime resorts, but could also be at public expense, reports Justin Arenstein</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mpumalanga government has handed over its main natural assets to an unknown foreign company and has promised not to talk about the deal for 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract which has been leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian allows the mysterious Dolphin Group to plunder the province's tourist attractions in a deal which has enraged conservationists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the extraordinary deal was announced with lavish fanfare on November 27, the Mpumalanga Parks Board, which arranged and signed it, has consistently refused to reveal details of its agreement with the mysterious group which has a convenience address in Dubai but is registered in Bermuda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contracts' terms are massively weighted in favour of the Dolphin Group and contain highly controversial provisions, which dismayed leading members of the province's Environmental Council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are shocked at the scope it gives Dolphin to exploit attractions including the Blyde River Canyon, Bourkes Luck, the Blyde River potholes and Pilgrim's Rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return for parks board's largesse, Dolphin will for 50 years subsidise the budget of the board. The province will stop funding the parks board in eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the contract does give the board the right to veto or adjust any Dolphin project on environmental grounds, this right is circumscribed by four clauses, one of which, for example, obliges it to &quot;carry on responsible and sound conservation practice so as to best enable Dolphin to exercise their commercial rights&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parks board boss Alan Gray has repeatedly denied that Dolphin's bankrolling of the parks board could create a conflict of interests when the board conducts environmental impact studies prior to approving Dolphin developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parks board agrees in two additional clauses to &quot;maximise developmental opportunities ... and maximise financial returns&quot; for Dolphin in Mpumalanga Province as it relates to the parks board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer who read through the contract this week questioned the failure of the government to call for public tenders for the project. At the launch Gray said the parks board had to secure foreign funding because South African entrepreneurs were not interested and it was too big for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer also said the agreement could be restrictive in terms of the Competitions Act of 1979, because it puts so many public assets in one province in the hands of one business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It contains one page of contributions Dolphin has to make and more than five pages of contributions the board must make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere does it give any figures of the revenue or profits Dolphin expects.  At the project launch Dolphin executives and Gray said the group would spend R300-million in &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; development in the first four years, which might rise to R400- million. Several thousand jobs would be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A diagram with the agreement allots up to 20% of shareholdings in some Dolphin subsidiaries to be established in Mpumalanga to &quot;disadvantaged business and community&quot; but gives no indication of what this means in money or jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the project launch both the board and Dolphin said the agreement would benefit disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another section of the contract commits the board to endeavour to ensure the current contracts for Mpumalanga tourist sites in board reserves such as Aventura Lodges in the Blyde River Canyon, the exclusive Bongani Lodge in the Mthethonmusha Reserve, be shifted to Dolphin by negotiation or when they end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These contracts will then be sold by Dolphin to sub-contractors for its own profit. The clause most seriously criticised by lawyers is that Dolphin may opt out of its financial obligations should there be any form of political instability, worsening security, civil unrest, or declining tourist arrivals over a period of only three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the situation has not improved after a further six months, Dolphin will have to pay the board only 7% of any revenue generated from its Mpumalanga enterprises instead of wholly funding the board's operations. This 7% payment, moreover, will be for three months only while the board looks for loans to cover its deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a seeming breach of normal management practices, the board also has to advise and consult with Dolphin before making any internal policy changes that might hurt Dolphin's profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract will be debated on January 16 in Nelspruit at a joint meeting of the board and the Environment Council, whose members include environmentalists such as Dr John Hanks, of the Worldwide Fund For Nature, Rupert Lorimer, and Dr Sue Hart, founder of Ecolink as well as a National Parks Board member. The meeting is expected to be heated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Crime along Durban's beachfront was at an all-time low this Christmas season, according to city officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear of beachfront violence saw several businesses close on certain days and surround their premises with razor-wire in advance of the holiday season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the local press shrieked &quot;Bloody beachfront&quot; headlines during the holiday period, SAPS director Bala Naidoo said this week that a record low of 18 crimes had been recorded on the beachfront between New Year's Eve and New Year's Day: &quot;Those few incidents were reported despite crowds swelling to more than 200 000 over the two days and a lot of alcohol being consumed. Last year we recorded 39 crimes over the same period,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo dismissed the widely reported claim by one police reservist of &quot;a crime every 30 seconds&quot; over the New Year holiday: &quot;We are investigating that comment, but common sense says it is impossible. That would mean two crimes a minute, 120 an hour and almost 3 000 a day. It's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christmas Day was also peaceful, with few incidents marring signs of racial integration in the crowded swimming areas as a handful of white and Indian families sunbathed and played together with the black majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban North Central African National Congress councillor and executive committee chairperson Nomusa Dube, whose area includes most of the beachfront, said she was &quot;convinced the paranoia promoted in some quarters is rooted in racism and nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were problems, but these involved a tiny minority of trouble- makers, and this year marked a 50% relief over last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inkatha Freedom Party Durban Metro councillor Anthony Grinker agreed: &quot;The problems were the exception. This debate has taken on serious racial overtones, with some white Durbanites comparing the beach to how it was ten years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other signs of racial problems included the mysterious disappearance of the street children over the holidays and the whiteness of the new official car-guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where did all the black parking attendants go?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's Dube also slated the closure of several beachfront businesses - one of which she said denied her entry in early December - over the holidays, and called for the city council to &quot;take a hard line against this practice.  Those businesses are leasing council land - the people's land - and many of them are renting it for next to nothing. If they can't provide services for all the people, they should not get those leases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube was referring to the decision by the popular - but mainly white - beachfront nightclub Joe Kools, the newly constructed Ocean Action Bar and several shops and restaurants, including the large pseudo- Spanish Tapas restuarant - which closed their doors on peak days, surrounding their premises with menacing-looking fences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban Unlimited chief executive Geoff Austin said the businesses which closed argued they weren't doing any business over the period: &quot;The holiday crowds don't frequent these places and they were afraid of damage,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other beachfront businesses said their colleagues were &quot;foolish&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The normally white-dominated beachfront bar, Riptides, was packed over the holidays with a mixed-race crowd: &quot;We doubled our turnover compared to the same period last year. We are finding that every year since the beaches opened, black patrons have more money to spend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had no security and no problems. The only incident was one person dropped their glass and someone cut their foot on it,&quot; said Riptides manager Alex Arhondonis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grinker said businesses were free do do as they wished, but added that closure &quot;didn't make a lot of business sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Durbanites need to welcome the opportunities provided by the new era.  Calls for locals to vacate the beach are crazy. The problem is not too many locals on the beach over the holidays, but too few for the rest of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need more people to use the beach year- round, so we can have more facilities, spread out the crowds and cater for the new clientele.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's Dube agreed: &quot;Many of the people who come now are crowding into Checkers and other places. They don't need a Joe Kools, they need a place to buy their bread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been a very good eye-opener for the city. We need to consult communities about how to make them feel welcome on the beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first challenge we face, however, is to realise the race lines are still open in this city.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The culture in the newly integrated army is still white, causing widespread racial problems. Rehana Rossouw reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT least four soldiers in the South African National Defence Force are currently being court-martialed on charges of alleging that their commanding officer was racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutions appear to reflect widespread race problems in the newly integrated SA National Defence Force (SANDF). Black soldiers at four defence force bases, informally surveyed by the Mail &amp; Guardian this week, complained about racism. They claim the culture of the army is still white and Afrikaans, and harsh measures are taken against soldiers who were members of non- statutory armies on the grounds of &quot;maintaining standards&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though they are prohibited by army regulations from giving information to the media, the soldiers said that racism is rife in the defence force and soldiers who are too outspoken have been targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been physical clashes between white and black soldiers in the Western Cape, which have led to soldiers being charged and found guilty of charges in military tribunals. The number of clashes and charges is unknown but soldiers said there were &quot;many&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black soldiers complain that their infringements of army discipline are treated harshly while infringements by white members are often overlooked.  They say their political leadership has abandoned them and does not respond to their complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soldiers said that shortly before the start in 1994 of their integration into the SANDF a policy called &quot;Operation Juggernaut&quot; was lanched.  They were told this was an attempt to maintain &quot;standards&quot; in the new defence force and which meant soldiers found violating military rules would be summarily dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, said a soldier based at the Youngsfield Military base in Cape Town who asked not to be named, meant maintaining the &quot;racist South African Defence Force norms&quot; which were not consistent with international military norms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It means black soldiers are ridiculed and ostracised by some of their white counterparts. What it is ultimately geared at is lowering the morale of former members of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and the Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla) in an attempt to force us out,&quot; said the soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already many people have left the army because of racism and harassment and there are many more who are thinking of leaving right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaints appear common across the Western Cape. In the Boland, two members of Group 31 Battalion are currently facing a court-martial on charges that they claimed their commanding officer was racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black soldiers at Group 31 claim their commanding officer, Colonel George McLoughlin, told them standards would be so high in his unit that MK and Apla members would be forced to seek employment at &quot;Shoprite and OK Bazaars&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group 31 soldiers said they had examples which clearly indicated that white soldiers who infringed military rules were not dealt with as harshly as black soldiers. A coloured member of the unit, Lieutenant- Colonel A Fredericks, was brought before a military tribunal and fined after being found guilty on charges of abandoning his post and using a military vehicle without authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group 31 soldiers say Fredericks received a telephone call from relatives in February last year claiming that a young girl had been abducted. The callers told him the police would not respond to a missing persons report until 24 hours had elapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fredericks set off in a military vehicle to find the girl. He managed to track her down and remove her from the men who had abducted her, before returning to his post. Two weeks later, members of the unit were informed that they were needed to assist a civilian who reported that he had lost his wallet. Group 31 soldiers were dispatched, in military vehicles with high- tech night vision equipment to search for the missing wallet. The officers who ordered them to assist were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shows clearly what kind of people were in command of Group 31. When a black child's life was threatened and a soldier who is sworn to protect the public went to help, he was disciplined. But when members were ordered to help a white man find his wallet, the officer who gave the order wasn't disciplined,&quot; said a soldier based at Group 31 who asked not to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soldiers at Group 31 claim the SANDF's refusal to fund Booysen and Pheiffer's legal costs because the lawyer defending them was in private practice, also smacked of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claim the army is paying the legal costs of Captain Dirk Rheede, who is white and based at Military Intelligence in Cape Town, who was charged with attempted murder following an incident which occurred while he was not on duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Rheede's case illustrates that not only black soldiers are concerned about racism in the SANDF. Rheede is alleged to have shot at a Lieutenant Potjie, a white soldier based at the castle in Cape Town who is facing charges of bringing the army into disrepute by claiming his commanding officer is racist and a poor manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former members of MK and Apla have also alleged that the SANDF was racist in its allocation of housing units in the Western Cape. However, a commission of inquiry instituted three months ago - consisting of two white officers - cleared the Western Cape command of any wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black soldiers claim their political leadership has abandoned them and that their appeals to ANC leaders for intervention have been ignored. A Lieutenant Magama, based at 9 South African Infantry Battalion, who allegedly wrote a letter to President Nelson Mandela complaining about alleged racism in the army, has been threatened with a court martial on the grounds that he should have complained to his commanding officer instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They use this all the time. They expect us to complain to the very people who are unjustly discriminating against us,&quot; said a former MK member who is now a lieutenant in the SANDF. The problem is, I don't think Joe Modise (Minister of Defence) and Ronnie Kasrils (Deputy Minister of Defence) know the half of what is going on in their army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very difficult to keep our sanity and remain in the SANDF in the face of constant racial attacks. They are trying to drive us out of the army and they are succeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Morale is very low among former cadres. It is getting to the stage where we are even too scared to support each other. When one of us is being targetted, the others keep their heads low in the hope that the trouble doesn't spill over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape Command of the SANDF, army headquarters in Pretoria and the Ministry of Defence said they were unable to comment on these allegations before the M&amp;G's deadline.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Stefaans BrUmmer investigates the suspects behind the Worcester and Rustenburg blasts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Boere Aanvalstroepe (Bat), which claimed responsibility for the Worcester and Rustenburg bomb attacks, appears to link directly to the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AWB leader Eugene Terre'Blanche this week told the Mail &amp; Guardian in an interview that Bat consisted of members of his organisation, but that the orders had not been his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Terre'Blanche denied he knew which members were responsible, police have taken an interest in the sequence of events that led to Bat claiming responsibility for the Worcester attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Johannesburg-based foreign correspondent, who asked not to be named, this week confirmed he had left his phone number with an AWB official at the organisation's head office hours before receiving a call from a man with a heavy Afrikaans accent. The man identified himself as &quot;John&quot; and claimed to represent &quot;a new organisation&quot; with an important announcement to make.  Shortly after the correspondent gave &quot;John&quot; a number for the South African Press Agency, the Bat statement was faxed to that agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bombing campaign in the Western Cape and North-West has come as something of a lifeline for the AWB and Terre'blanche - but if police suspicions prove to be correct, the lifeline may well turn into a noose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terre'blanche's &quot;admission&quot; may have been a play for the political centre stage - he said only he and President Nelson Mandela, together, could avert the &quot;oncoming revolution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cynics may dismiss it as posturing by a has-been leader of a spent force who has played the card of looming war once too often already; pulling it from his sleeve again in the hope that the Madiba magic will rub off on him too and revive his flagging fortunes. But if Bat links directly to the AWB headquarters, it could spell trouble for the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men police have said could &quot;help in the investigation&quot; into the Worcester Christmas Eve bombing are AWB members. Christiaan Harmse, one of the two men arrested shortly after last weekend's bombings in the Rustenburg area, is also a member of the AWB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While police have been careful not to link convicted AWB bombers Jan Bastiaan de Wet, Abraham &quot;Koper&quot; Myburgh and Nicolaas &quot;Cliffie&quot; Barnard directly to the Worcester bombing, the reason for their unstated suspicion is clear - the trio appear to have been seen in the Worcester area late last year. In addition, the Worcester bomb, like the Rustenburg bombs, bore the &quot; fingerprint&quot; of earlier AWB bombs: a metal pipe filled with similar explosives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Wet, who escaped from prison last March with Barnard and Myburgh before they were convicted in absentia for their part in the 1994 election bombing campaign that killed 20, was rearrested this week on a Randfontein plot belonging to AWB &quot;general&quot; Japie Oelofse. For now, the only new charges against De Wet relate to his escape and the possession of a stolen vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terre'blanche, in his vintage mixture of bombast and oratory poetry, this week told the M&amp;G in Ventersdorp that the government &quot;walking over the aspirations&quot; of Boers and Zulus would lead to war, and that only he and Mandela could prevent it, should Mandela be willing to meet him and &quot;make a kind of agreement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief among Terre'blanche's demands is that rightwingers in prison for &quot; political&quot; offences be released immediately; the extension of the amnesty cut- off date, which will benefit mainly rightwingers, not being enough. &quot; (Mandela) is the president, he must just say, 'I'll send the soldiers home.'..  . It will take years for people to go to a so-called human rights court. In the meantime people are dying again, and they will die in their hundreds of thousands. Stop the reason for the bombings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terre'blanche claimed the AWB still had 60 000 to 70 000 listed members. &quot;I gave no instruction to retaliate, but you must realise that 90% of AWB people are trained soldiers. If they make only 500 pipe bombs, they will blow this country to hell in one night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he and the AWB &quot;general staff&quot; had lost control of individual members, who were responsible for the bombings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Captain Piet Reynecke, investigating officer into the Rustenburg blasts, this week said no evidence had been uncovered to connect the Worcester and Rustenburg incidents, and top intelligence officer Mo Shaik slighted the threat by talking of &quot;Brandy and Coke Ossewa&quot; militant right- wing cells, some information points towards an at least loosely co-ordinated campaign within the orbit of the AWB and related right-wing structures. This includes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Investigators' suspicion has been raised by the &quot;coincidence&quot; of the same lawyers acting for De Wet and Rustenburg bombing suspects Pierre Jacobs and Harmse. The advocate already retained by their lawyers, Louisa van der Walt, also appeared for the defence during trial of the 1994 election bombers. The source of their legal funding this week remained a mystery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Intelligence and police investigators have information on foreign right- wing support for local groups, which could boost the local capacity for terror considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Worcester and Rustenburg incidents have not been the only ones in the last six months. North-west Premier Popo Molefe has talked of six arrests in six weeks, including that of white miners attempting to steal commercial explosives from mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two rightwingers, one of them AWB member Fred Joubert, were arrested in the North- West last October in possession of explosives, fuses and other equipment. Rustenburg magistrates sentenced Joubert to R2 000 or one year's imprisonment in Rustenburg this week, and his co-accused, Gert van der Westhuizen, to a similarly light sentence late last year, after the prosecution failed to prove they had intended to use the explosives for terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A formerly whites-only Ventersdorp primary school, now renamed Kgololosego, was damaged in a pipe bomb explosion in July after a Communist Party march.  The investigation is being handled by investigators from the South African Police Service Internal Security division, who confirmed this week that a Ventersdorp AWB member has been implicated, but said there was no direct evidence against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The M&amp;G this week learnt of an interest shown by intelligence officials in an alleged &quot;bomb factory&quot; near Ventersdorp, while it also received unconfirmed information about a farm in the area containing a large cache of military equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as South Africa grapples with the realisation that terror is not a tactic only of the past, it appears the country's security agencies are also grappling to form a coherent picture of the extent of the threat. One well- placed security official this week spoke of far more sinister right-wing groups that have yet to flex their muscles, but acknowledged: &quot;The truth is, we really don't have a clue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Angola's peace process needs to be extended by two to three months to give Uniaco Nacional para a (Unita) and Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) leaders more time to negotiate Jonas Savimbi's role in the Angolan government, said Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen, after a meeting with Savimbi mid- week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi met his friend, Viljoen, in Pretoria on Wednesday after three days of talks about the Angolan peace process with President Nelson Mandela and senior Cabinet ministers in Umtata. Viljoen confirmed that he supported Savimbi's rejection of the role of second vice-president in the Dos Santos government, arguing that he deserved something better.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should not rush into a disaster,&quot; said Viljoen, speaking of the target dates over the next month which had been planned by the United Nations to phase in the new Angolan Government, elected in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears are being being raised by analysts that the first meeting of the Angolan National Assembly, scheduled for later this month, will not take place because of the failure of the two sides to define Savimbi's role, status, powers and salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A month or two of planning and further negotiations would be worthwhile at this stage. Dr Savimbi, however, was upbeat. He recognised the fact that the process is at a critical stage and is serious about finding a solution,&quot; said Viljoen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following talks with Savimbi, South African cabinet leaders announced that the government would assist with the process of establishing a functioning government of national unity in Luanda, although actual details of the nature of that assistance have not been disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to read Mandela's intentions have been stymied by a lack of information and a refusal by the government to explain any of the background.  In addition, according to the president's representative Parks Mankahlana, there was a misleading media report that the South African government would be directly mediating in the conflict, assisting and facilitating where possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's willingness to spend two days with Savimbi is seen as a strategically significant move, given that the African National Congress was traditionally allied to his opponents, the MPLA. The government is insisting it will be even-handed in its assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that Deputy President Thabo Mbeki will be at the forefront of South Africa's effort, and may well help to convene a much needed face-to- face meeting between Savimbi and his former foe, Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos for a bout of hard talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critical issue will be to hammer out a role for Savimbi which will satisfy both sides of the political coin, and to institute a process of reconciliation to unite the divided country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allocation of resources is one of the key issues as all the major players have a vested interest in them, according to Stephen Ellis, a researcher at the African Studies Centre in Leiden, the Netherlands. Ellis was sceptical about South Africa's ability to broker a deal over Savimbi where other countries and the UN had failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the things that has always caused the breakdown in negotiation before was that the key people on both sides, Unita and MPLA, have so much vested interest in the war. The government can go on forever living off the profits from the oil, and Unita can do the same on the profit from diamond sales. The people in Angola need peace, but their leaders are doing as well out of the war as they would out of peace, and peace is the big unknown,&quot; Ellis said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A leading British bookmaker, William Hill, is betting on Cape Town as the site for the 2004 Olympic at the very generous odds of 6 to 4, followed by Rome with 2 to 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the international magazine Sports Business puts Cape Town in third place, behind Rome and Stockholm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) decides on March 7 on the final cities from which the eventual winner will be selected - to be announced on September 5. The IOC may initially elect four, and if two cities are neck and neck, can go for five.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The odds offered by William Hill on other cities are: Athens 7 to 2, Buenos Aires and Stockholm 12 to 1, Rio de Janeiro 14 to 1, St Petersburg 63 to 1, Istanbul 20 to 1, Lille 50 to 1, San Juan 66 to 1 and Seville 100 to 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Ball, chief executive officer of Cape Town's bid company, told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that he believed the city's proposal for the Games was unrivalled by any of the other ten bidding cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I seriously believe that we have put forward the best proposal to the International Olympic Committee and that we have the best logistical support to host the Games,&quot; Ball said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odds given by betting agencies are notoriously inaccurate and therefore, according to one of the bid's staunchest opponents, former Cape Town city councillor Arthur Wienburg, there was &quot;pure speculation&quot; about the September 5 decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suspect that Cape Town will be included in the last four or five citiessimply because this will be a politically correct decision by the IOC.  Cape Town will also be included as it is the only African city to bid and the IOC will be keen to sustain worldwide interest in the bidding process,&quot; said Wienburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added the warning often sounded by opponents of the bid, that Cape Town does not have the infrastructure for the Games. &quot;The IOC must surely realise that Cape Town is simply too small for the Olympic Games,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid company insists, however, that the Evaluation Commission of the IOC which visited Cape Town early last month left impressed with what the Mother City has to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the members of the IOC Evaluation Commission are very professional and thus will not comment to us on what they saw here, the vibes that I have picked up from them are very positive,&quot; said Ball. &quot;One should always be cautious, but I think we will be in the final four or five cities.  Thereafter I think we are still strongly in the running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, Ball has come under fire for his management style from various groups, including the Development Action Group, a housing forum opposed to the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ball said he was unaware of criticism levelled at him but his door was open to anyone willing to confront him with complaints. &quot;I am willing to admit that I am imperfect and not always the most open person, but I have a job to do and that is to make sure that Cape Town wins the bid,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted that there had in the past been &quot;tensions&quot; between the bid company and the National Olympic Committee of South Africa and these had undermined the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This relationship is now very strong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A plan for Russia to train South Africans as astronauts - announced 14 months ago amid much fanfare - has run into financial difficulties, with both countries reluctant to foot the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a visit to South Africa at the end of 1995, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets told Deputy President Thabo Mbeki that Russia was willing to send a group of young South Africans to Moscow to train in Russia's space programme. Mbeki accepted the offer and announced it at a diplomatic function in Pretoria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, once representatives of the two countries met to discuss the plan, the issue of the price tag arose. &quot;It's a costly operation,&quot; said Frank Chikane, director general of the deputy president's office, &quot;and we made it clear we didn't have the resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Chikane says negotiations around the plan are ongoing, and they are looking for ways to resolve the financial difficulty. &quot;Diplomatic things move slowly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian press attache Dimitri Erutin confirmed that the offer had been made and accepted and that the difficulty now was one of finances. &quot;The plan is under consideration by both sides now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no one is saying so, it seems &quot;the issue of finances arose&quot; because the Russians actually wanted to be paid for the training programme and Soskovets's offer came with a hidden price tag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian space programme is having financial difficulties itself, and the crash of its Mars space probe last year was a devastating blow. Space agencies around the world can no longer rely on government funding for their programmes, but raise money by getting countries and companies to pay them for launching satellites or carrying experiments on board their space craft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the astronaut plan is not South Africa's only way into space: the country is also involved in other aspects of space technology, especially satellites. Nasa will launch a South African microsatellite into space this year, at no cost, in exchange for data from the microsatellite.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Gauteng throws its investigation nets wider after shocking revelations from matric cheats, reports Andy Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confessions from Gauteng's matric cheats this week have prompted the province to widen its investigation to include the elite academics who drew up the exam papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng Education MEC Mary Metcalfe told the Mail &amp; Guardian that statements from several accused pupils suggest examiners in at least two subjects could be implicated in the cheating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province's examiners are drawn from its top state and independent schools, and universities. So far 28 of the 1 413 matric candidates under investigation for alleged irregularities have appeared before the two panels (one in Johannesburg and one in Pretoria) probing the accusations - 15 of these have confessed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metcalfe says the links to examiners were an &quot;unanticipated but not entirely unexpected&quot; outcome of the hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For years people working within white education have known of a culture of hints and this is what we are uncovering. It is being investigated for the first time,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the worst symptom of that culture, and the motive is symptomatic of the moral decay that exists where schools are driven by the glory of pass rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyebrows have also been raised within teaching circles about similarities between the matric papers and mock exams students took just weeks before at several top performing schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metcalfe says she has no evidence so far to support such suspicions, but the investigation will widen as further cases are uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds that the provincial education department remains confident of the integrity of its examiners. &quot;There is an acknowledgment that to be appointed as an examiner is a professional honour,&quot; she says. &quot;They are expected to abide by a professional code of conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are already investigating the theft of exam papers - three people have been arrested. Metcalfe says any examiner found to have passed on matric information prior to the exams will be professionally censured - and probably banned from future involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's hearings are the first time the cheating has been clearly linked to the top echelons of the academic world, completing a chain of corruption that rings the province's education system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside the pupils, teachers and principals have been accused, invigilators have been fingered and employees of the education department have also been drawn into the net. Metcalfe says, however, that no senior department officials have been implicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leak of exam papers amounted more to petty pilfering than a grand conspiracy, she adds. The majority of cheating cases involved pupils smuggling notes into the exam hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent school Crawford College denied this week that there was any link between its staff's involvement in the matric process and the performance of its Johannesburg and Pretoria campuses - the first-best and second-best performers in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Graeme Crawford says 10 staff members were invited to take part in the 1996 matric - including examiners, markers and moderators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he adds that the school had also led the province in 1995, when its staff were not involved in the matric set-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributes the performance to the schools' mode of teaching, which he says encourages pupils to think for themselves rather than to memorise facts long enough to reproduce them on exam day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The shootout between French troops and mutineers of the Central African Republic army, French President Jacques Chirac's call for intervention in eastern Zaire and the battle for privatization of Cote D'Ivoire's telecommunications service were the issues discussed in editorials in the African press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soleil commented on the reasons for the shooting to death of two French soldiers by the Mutineers in Bangui.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred, it said, because the mutineers were frustrated by the presence of French soldiers who frustrated the rebels' attempt to overthrow President Ange-Felix Patasse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that the former Malian military leader, Amadou Toumani Toure, was the leading peace negotiator between the mutineers and the government but wondered whether, under the circumstances, he would succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will the mutineers have the strength to overcome their resentment, after the shooting, and engage in dialogue?&quot; it asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa newspapers focused on the talks between Presidents Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, to find solution to the Banyamulenge revolt in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Kinshasa bi-weekly, La Societe, said that Moi, with backing of France and the United States, had tried to convince Mobutu to negotiate with the Banyamulenge leader, Laurent Kabila, and his allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan approach, it said, confirmed that Zaire's eastern neighbors, particularly Uganda and Rwanda, supported Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another bi-weekly, L' Avenir, wondered whether after Zaire's &quot;humiliating battle losses&quot; at the hand of the Banyamulenge, Kinshasa would negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Dakar newspaper, Sud Quotidien, noted that French President Jacques Chirac had called for an international force to end the rebellion. But, it noted, since the United States remained indifferent to this proposal, France was unable and would not try to intervene alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On economic matters, Ivorian newspapers commented on the plans to privatize the country's telecommunications sector. They also spoke of the battle between French and Malay interests for the Ivorian concern, CI-Telecom, which was the center of this privatization bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abidjan paper, Jour, said that the so-called privatization of CI- Telecom looked like &quot;a masquerade&quot; for selling it to France Telecom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this masquerade has been confirmed by the authorities, businessmen should draw conclusions,&quot; it said, and that would be that &quot;Cote D'Ivoire is well and truly the preserve of French business interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, Republicain Ivoirien said that the French could not possibly lose out because Paris &quot;considers Cote D'Ivoire as Africa's showcase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, it said, it wondered whether bidding had been fair since France already controlled the Ivorian energy and water utilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overall, the (President Konan) Bedie government is the winner. With these gifts to France, it can expect to continue being the guarantor of French interest in Cote d'Ivoire,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Voie, another Abidjan paper, referred to an &quot;underground war&quot; between the U.S. and France (through Africa Bell and France Telecom), and said that the U.S. had been kept out of the deal to the advantage of the French.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - An outbreak of cholera has killed more than 100 people in the troubled Great Lakes region, currently teeming with refugees or displaced persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death toll was revealed here Thursday by the head of epidemiological services at the Brazzaville-based African regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Andre Ndikuyeze.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference to review the situation since fighting erupted in eastern Zaire last September, he said 8,000 cases of diarrhoea and 100 cases of cholera had been registered on the Rwanda-Zaire border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease killed five of the cases diagnosed, the WHO official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndikuyeze said that 100 deaths were recorded from 3,500 cases which were diagnosed among refugees who crossed from Zaire to Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cholera epidemic, he added, had killed 10 people in Burundi's Rumonge province. However, the epidemic had been controlled and the cholera- related mortality had also been reduced all over the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Sumner Dagogo-Jack, said Thursday that these polls would be preceded, on Feb. 24, by ward congresses to nominate candidates and select delegates for local council party congresses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council polls, initially scheduled for the last quarter of 1996, were postponed following the creation of 183 new local council areas in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian legislators have recommended that a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment be established, as a way of protecting the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislators resolved, at the country's fist workshop on Environmental Education for legislators, that parliament enact laws to regulate, monitor and implement the use of the natural resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Laws should be introduced to provide a price tag on industries who pollute the environment,&quot; they said. &quot;By laws should also be introduced by councils to ensure that every village have pit latrines as part of clean environment programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In understanding the existing practices that compound environmental degradation, and the constraints in promoting environmental education in formal and informal ways, the legislators recommended that the Ministry of Environment be classified as a priority ministry, to ensure that more funds are allocated to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop -- held last week, in Siavonga, south of Lusaka -- was attended by 28 parliamentarians from each of the country's nine provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was aimed at creating an in-depth understanding of environmental issues, as well as elaborating measures to mitigate the negative effects of environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia loses an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 hectares of forests each year.  Because of this rate of exploitation, officials say, the country is likely to experience a shortage of forest resources in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other environmental degradation cited at the workshop was lose of soil productivity which is causing extensive land abandonment because of current practices in agriculture and animal husbandry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some parts of Zambia, soil loss on cultivated land is estimated at between 12.5 and 20 tonnes per hectare annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists observe that through deforestation, illegal hunting and over-fishing, a number of species in Zambia may soon be lost completely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - On December 5, 1995, in a village in Maputo Province, Mozambique, several children were collecting scrap metal to sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the bits they found was a land mine. When the metal was weighed on a scale in the market, the land mine exploded, instantly killing eight children.  Three others died in hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This happened three years after the peace agreement ended the 16-year civil war. Since then, in Maputo Province alone, 98 people have stepped on land mines. Out of these, 68 were children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every Southern African country, except Lesotho and Mauritius, has had people wounded or killed by land mines. Officials estimate that at least 20 million of these devices have been laid in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weapons lie hidden and awaiting the footsteps of a woman gathering firewood or a child fetching water. Long after a conflict ends, land mines threaten villagers, render farmland unusable, and disrupt transport and market systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To end the carnage, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines has tried to get an immediate and permanent end to their use, manufacture, export and stockpiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization's next conference, to making all of Southern Africa mine- free, will be held in Maputo from from Feb. 25 to 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 17 countries most severely plagued by antipersonnel mines, seven are in Africa. Three of these -- Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe -- are in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two nations in the sub-region, South Africa and Zimbabwe, have manufactured land mines. Angola has between eight million and 20 million mines in its soil -- more than one for each of its 10 million people. In Mozambique, about one million land mines remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizers of the forthcoming conference said Monday that the gathering would consist of speeches, panel discussions, workshops, papers as well as visits to demining sites and training centers, prosthetics and rehabilitation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants would review the scale of the regional land mine problem, its socio-economic consequences and how these weapons affect women, refugees, the internally displaced and returning populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also examine case studies of Angola and Mozambique and hear the experience of land mine survivors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The Ghana government has agreed to transfer to Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited (AGC) government's interests, or rights to an interest, in the company's assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghana News Agency, which reported the deal Monday, did not say when the agreement was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it said that the interests were a 10-percent government share holding in the Ghanaian-Australian Goldfields (GAG), a 10-percent shareholding in Cluff Resources Ghana Limited and a right to acquire 10- percent interest in Ashanti Gold's Bibiani project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total consideration of the transfers are valued at 15.9 million U.S.  dollars. Of this, 13.9 million dollars will be settled by the issue of new AGC shares at a price of 13.81 dollars. This is equal to the average of AGC ordinary share price for five dealing days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GAG is a 70-percent subsidiary of AGC, acquired through completion of the merger of AGC and Golden Shamrock Mines Limited. Cluff Resources Ghana Limited's principal asset is the Ayanfuri Mine in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government currently holds 18.6 percent of the issued share capital of AGC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and AGC said &quot;on completion of the transfers, the government will hold 19.4 percent of the issued ordinary share capital of Ashanti which will stand at 108,059,481 shares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Except in limited circumstances, or with the prior consent of Ashanti, the government has agreed not to dispose of the new Ashanti ordinary shares being issued as consideration for the Transfer for a period of 12 months,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government and AGC anticipate that the new AGC ordinary shares will be admitted to listing on the London Stock Exchange on January 20, at the same time as the transfers are completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listings will be obtained on the Ghana, New York, Toronto, Zimbabwe and Australian Stock Exchanges shortly afterwards. AGC is already listed on all these exchanges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Well trained personnel, rather than sufficient natural resources, hold the key to Africa's economic growth, a leading academic said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Benneh, who is president of the Association of African Universities, said this in Lusaka, Zambia, at the opening of the assocition's ninth general conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited Japan, Singapore and South Korea as some of the countries which had applied brain power to join the club of developed nations, even though they are endowed with scant natural resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the challenge that faces African universities and this is also the reason why African governments have to invest more in training and research,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African universities, he said, needed to increase research and help society find solutions to problems like hunger, disease and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to reach these types of goals, he said, could make African universities lose public confidence in the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the same conference, the secretary-general of the Association of International Universities, Franz Eberhard, said that it was crucial for developing countries to break out of downward spiral of dependence and of underdevelopment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, too, said that governments had a crucial role of funding higher education and research, as well as creating the right atmosphere to enable African scholars to deliver what was expected of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who officially opened the conference Monday, appealed to demographers, economists and other social scientists to examine, critically, some of the current theories which he said were alien to African conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said that academics should develop come up with theories that more correctly explained Africa's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week-long seminar has drawn participants from almost all African countries, including representatives from international organizations and donor community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association was created to encourage contacts between its 142 members and the international academic world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - The prolonged dispute between university lecturers and government over pay is finally over following the former's acceptance of a 90% phased salary rise beginning this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the settlement of the dispute, students, who failed to write their end of year examinations in July when the lecturers went on strike, are expected to report between January 10-12 for their examinations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polytechnic and Chancellor College students had to be sent home before writing their final year exams. Students from Bunda College and Kamuzu College of Nursing wrote their exams but their lecturers refused to mark them until the dispute was resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government has responded positively to what was compromised between University Council subcommittee and representatives of staff and students,&quot; said Chancellor College Principal Dr Emmanuel Fabiano. Fabiano said the students will be given time to revise their work before writing their end-of- year exams, which have to be processed before the new school session begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government also accepted to review professional allowances for lecturers and administrative staff. A finance officer in the University Office, Stanley Namandwa, said the first increment in the phased structure will be for 50% effective January, 1997. The next pay rise will be for 25% starting April and will be on the salaries after the 50% January increment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Four UDF heavyweights in Mulanje, south Malawi, are embroiled in a row with traditional leaders over land previously occupied by the defunct Malawi Young Pioneers. The four, Information, Broadcasting, Posts and Telecoms minister, Brown Mpinganjira, Deputy Finance minister, Lizzie Lossa, Admarc General Manager, Eunice Kazembe and businessman, Joseph Mlelemba, are sharing the 350-acre piece of land the ministry of Lands and Valuation apportioned them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional leaders want the land to be distributed to the landless villagers and query the criteria used by the ministry in distributing the land to the four politicians. The land lies 10 kms west of Mulanje district headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the wrangle, one man from the area has threatened to sue the four people unless the ministry rescinds its decision to share the land among them. Robert Chibwana, a bursar at Kamuzu Academy and who comes from the area, said he was going to consult with chiefs and village headmen in the area on the court action. &quot;We feel the action taken by these UDF leaders is uncalled for because they are depriving land from the people who live in that area by taking advantage of their positions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Malawi and Zambia are two countries in southern Africa that have been identified to participate in the initial phase of a pilot programme of assistance to people with HIV/Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN resident coordinator, Terence Jones, says this follows as a result of the findings in November 1996 by the UN Volunteers consultative mission which looked for countries where the project would be useful depending mainly on 'the existence of strong networks of people living with HIV/AIDS.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terence said the mission held talks with the National Aids Control Programme (NACP) and other groups involved in the care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS, discussing policy making and strengthening support groups and networks, among other objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been designed on the premise that people living with and those with HIV/Aids are potentially the most effective educators, counselors, campaigners and care givers, given appropriate support,&quot; said Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a consultative workshop, involving major partners like non- governmental organisations, donors, support groups and the UN, will be held within the next three months to get a common vision of the project and develop a work plan as well as identify training needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, according to NACP, Malawi was expected to record nearly 5,000 new HIV cases, almost the same figure recorded in 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Executive Director of the Bible Society of Malawi, Byson Nakhutho and Social Democratic Party president, Eston Kakhome on December 23 denied having organised a meeting to plot a scheme on the burning of mosques in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bakili Muluzi said on December 22 that Kakhome, Nakhuto and People's Democratic Party president Rolf Patel, organised a secret meeting at the Bible Society offices to plot religious unrest by burning down mosques for political gains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nakhuto said although a meeting took place to discuss allegations about the burning of Bibles by Moslems, the meeting never discussed the burning of mosques, adding he did not attend the specific meeting anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kakhome also rebuffed Muluzi's allegations and accused him of making public statements before weighing facts before them. He asked Muluzi to carry out thorough investigations into the issue and reprimand the people who are spreading the rumours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi is a Moslem. The president's allegations came in the wake of media reports that Muluzi wants to &quot;Islamise&quot; the country through, among other things, building mosques and foreign funded Islamic educational institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - The Balaka-based (south Malawi) Allelluya Band has put its weight behind concerned citizens and other human rights bodies to woo public support against capital punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time in the history of the country's prisons, the band performed at Zomba Central Prison on December 30, in response to a public outcry against the death sentence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Band leader and founder, Paul Banda said the decision to perform at the prison comes in the wake of findings by the Catholic magazine, Together, which sought people's views on death penalty. Banda said that through the magazine readers unanimously expressed a strong desire for the government to abolish capital punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said music has the power to transform society from bad to good. The move to hold the show in the prison premises was initiated by Rev Father Peter Gamba of the Montfort Press. Zomba was chosen as the first venue of the show because it has the most prisoners on death row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want people of Malawi, including chiefs and parents, to rally against the death penalty.&quot; During a constitutional conference in 1994, chiefs voiced strong sentiments against abolishing the death penalty as punishment for convicted murderers. They argued that the move would pose a great threat to society by 'encouraging people to murder each other at will knowing they would not be hanged'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi has come under strong pressure from human rights organisations within and without to abolish capital punishment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Smallholder farmer, Chitenje Mwamadi, is one person who has been converted to and is practicing the government's gospel propagating the growing of hybrid maize varieties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has seen the benefit of planting her small piece of land, as recommended by the government, with hybrid maize varieties which are believed to be higher yielding than local varieties. &quot;It took a lot of conviction for me to change from planting the old maize variety to hybrid. I am very happy now,&quot; said Mwamadi, comparing the 9 bags she used to harvest before to the 28 bags she now reaps from the same 0.2 hectare piece of land.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi - suffering chronic food shortages - is pushing for increased maize production. Last year the government launched the Maize Productivity Programme. This seeks to develop technologies that should improve efficiency in the use of fertilisers and promote crop diversification through the provision of a wide range of seeds. The programme aims to carry out extension campaigns targeted at poor farmers and train extension staff on new technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maize, largely grown by smallholder farmers in small pieces of land is the country's staple food. &quot;Over the past years, there has been a decline in the maize productivity of smallholder farmers, a trend that poses a threat to household food security,&quot; Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Lizzie Lossa said last October at World Food Day Celebrations in the capital Lilongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She listed factors that had contributed to the decline in maize production as poor uptake of improved seed, problems in managing soil fertility, poor resource base by smallholder farmers to enable them to purchase inputs and recurrent droughts. Between 1991 and 1994, Malawi witnessed three droughts which reduced food production by half. The decline in maize production has resulted in low per capita calorie consumption by most households. Half of Malawi's children suffer from chronic malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation showed that maize occupied 58.1% of the areas cultivated by smallholder farmers in 1994, a major percentage reduction when compared to 1978/88 when it occupied about 70% of the areas cropped. FAO said in 1994/95, 70% of maize planted were local low yielding varieties, whilst 29.7% were hybrid. Throughout the 1980s, 90% of maize planted by smallholders were low yielding local varieties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the introduction of the semi-flint hybrids in 1990, there has been a gradual increase in the percentage of the areas planted with hybrids,&quot; said the FAO report. In 1992/93 - which was a good rainfall year - hybrids represented 24.5% of the maize planted, which fell back to 18.3% in 1993/94 which had poor rainfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With free fertiliser and hybrid seed distribution in 1994/95, hybrids plantings increased to 29.7%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates show that there was growth of 1.3337% per annum in the growth rate in smallholder maize production over the period 1983/84 to 1995/96.  However, the introduction of semi-flint hybrids in 1990 saw positive growth of hybrids with an annual growth rate of 10.088%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the report cites a number of constraints which negatively affected the country's agriculture. Although the constraints have been documented, they are yet to be removed, which will continue to impact negatively on Malawi's food security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the constraints, according to the report, were land tenure and access to land, limited access to and the nature of agricultural extension messages, poor rural feeder roads, poor pricing of farm inputs and high prices of farm inputs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE - In 1993, a group of motor cycle riders entered Zimbabwe's Mashonaland Central Province and discovered that living conditions in the commercial farms were poor. There were no pre-schools, no toilets and hundreds of children were malnourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From a humble beginning established three years ago on 25 motor cycles, the &quot;Riders for Health&quot; in Zimbabwe have today improved nutrition levels among labourers in some commercial farms and there are plans to expand the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since their arrival in this Southern African country with a population of 11 million people, the Riders for Health group has assisted about 250,000 Zimbabweans, mainly children of farm workers whose standard of living is not so good owing to high illiteracy levels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the encouraging response from the farmers, their labourers and the co-operation of the government, the riders have been able to work with ministries of Health, Education and the former National Affairs to train farm workers to maintain good hygiene, build toilets and participate in literacy classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mike Gatton of Save the Children Fund (UK) told APS of the setting up of Farm Community Trust of Zimbabwe to give the health programme a national outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust which comprises nine people from SCF, farm workers, farmers, the government and some donors, requires 200 motor cycles to enable officials reach every corner of the country in a bid to improve poor people's lives all over the country, said Mr.Gatton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the Farm Community Trust of Zimbabwe has been set up and that is a good indication of the government's positiveness. What we are doing is to make it more effective for officials of the government. They are able to reach the people than sitting in an office,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-ordinator for the farm Community Trust of Zimbabwe, Mrs. Lynette Mudekunye believes the programme will be a resounding success in the next two to three years as many people will have been trained to ride the motor cycles and to show their fellow country men how the scheme works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On why the SCF insists on motor cycles instead of cars, she said cars were more expensive and they can easily tempt users to engage themselves in personal business. &quot;Motor cycles can't be diverted to those things other than that which they are assigned. We want to be cost effective&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SCF is spending US$100,000 a year in the training of literacy tutors, women's clubs and construction of buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To demonstrate that the government was happy with the Riders for Health plan, it has acquire 110 motor cycles for its department of Social Welfare thanks to assistance from the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fleet coordinator, Mr. Alfred Gonga said several environmental health technicians have been deployed in all the country's provinces since the riders were accepted by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They asked us to train their people since 1994. We visit every quarter of the country and we agreed nobody must ride those motor cycles before we train them,&quot; said Mr. Gonga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Riders for Health programme, if allowed to continue should see Zimbabwe improve some aspects of its health sector which have been neglected since the more than one billion dollar budget was subsequently reduced by one third due to a shortage of government funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Mr. Herbert Murerwa allocated $1,810,157 for the 1996-97 period. This was a 17 per cent increase over the previous year when the Health Minister Dr. Timothy Stamps had to ask for supplementary budgets to meet the ministry's requirements. In 1995- 96 the allocation was $1,545,481, 838 and because of the high cost of living, more money had to be poured into the coffers of the sector only to be cut later, causing national outcry from churches and human rights organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Riders for Health group provides what will, given support, turn out to be something of a breakthrough in the delivery of health and other outreach services in Africa. The way in which motor cycles have been wasted and their potential destroyed in the great motorcycle disaster should not be ignored or underestimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the programme began in 1989, there has only been one fleet in Malawi that has been well managed. But that was a small fleet - it costs a great deal to run it and it suffered a very high number of accidents. Riders for Health fleets are run in the most cost efficient manner possible and suffer very low accident rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People using motorcycles in outreach programmes or feel that it would be appropriate to do so, should talk to Riders for Health, who have shown in countries where they have programmes that future development of health and other services using motorcycles save a great deal of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme was begun by motor-cyclists and was nurtured by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and friends and colleagues of Save the Children Fund (UK). It is now an independent organisation with its roots in the motorcycle community and it is supported by manufacturers, dealers, competitors (including world champions) and by helpful and enthusiastic motor- cyclists in Europe, Australia and North America. This is a powerful resource on which to draw and it is the organisation's guarantee of its ability to provide a successful and predictable service to clients in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KIGALI - A nurse and a former local government official were sentenced to death on January 3 in the first verdicts handed down for the 1994 ethnic massacres in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process has finally begun. Rwanda's overloaded justice system is trying to come to grips with the killings of more than 500,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu extremists in four terrifying months of civil war, triggered by the death of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and his Hutu counterpart in Burundi Cyprien Ntaryamira in a plane crash near the capital Kigali on April 6, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurse Deogratias Bizimana and former local official Egide Gatanazi, whose trials opened on December 27, have two weeks to appeal against the sentences handed down by the court in Kibungo in south-east Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite numerous witnesses' statements, they pleaded innocent in their trial on December 27, which lasted just a few hours before being rescheduled for sentencing, and during which they had no legal representation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bizimana faced 11 counts of taking part in massacres and leading death squads, as well as possessing arms, pillaging and refusing to help those in danger. He confessed after being arrested, but during the trial said the confession was extracted under torture. The father of two told Radio Rwanda that he was &quot;sure of getting out of&quot; his sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gatanazi, 43, was charged with murder, rape and theft. He said the case was a plot against him and insisted he was innocent, even though his own sister testified against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death sentence has never been abolished in Rwanda, but no one has faced the firing squad since the end of the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 90,000 people are crammed into Rwandan jails and living in horrific conditions as they await trial for the 1994 bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A United nations court also due to hold war crime trials has been set up in Arusha, Tanzania, but it will only deal with the suspected ringleaders, leaving lesser officials to the domestic Rwandan judiciary. About 20 people have been indicted, many of them now living in exile abroad, but so far none of the trials has opened. Unlike the Rwandan courts, it will not hand down death sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil war ended when the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels seized power in Kigali in July 1994, ousting the Hutu-led government and sending several millions of Hutu refugees fleeing into neighbouring countries like Zaire and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judicial sources said on December 31 that suspected ringleader of the killing Froduald Karamira who was arrested in June at Addis Ababa airport, Ethiopia, will go on trial on January 14 in Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A businessman before all the killings started, Karamira led a Hutu group called &quot;Power&quot;, which opposed any accommodation with the minority Tutsis. He tried to flee the country, but was arrested last June in Adis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 31, a former Rwandan school teacher became the fifth suspect to stand trial in Rwanda in connection with the 1994 genocide of half a million people, Rwanda national radio reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francois Bizimutima, accused of leading an extremist Hutu organisation heavily implicated in the four-month bloodbath, stood in the dock in the northern town of Byumba, but the trial was put back until January 9 after the defendant asked for more time to prepare his case. Accused of allegedly planning and carrying out massacres during the ethnic bloodletting from April to July 1994, he requested in particular time to find a lawyer and witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current Tutsi-led government in Rwanda says Karamira organized massacres and went on radio and television to incite Hutus to kill Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other trials have also been started and adjourned, one indefinitely, the others until January and February. According to Radio Rwanda, two other trials would open on January 14 in Nyamata, south of Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opposition groups, including the Resistance Forces for Democracy (RFD) and the main organisation supporting the millions who fled Rwanda after the genocide, the Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy to Rwanda (RPD), remain extremely concerned by the legal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement received in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, the RFD said the Rwandan judicial system was &quot;incapable of meeting the fair and conciliatory justice that the country needs,&quot; while the RFP, for its part, appealed to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to &quot;get more involved&quot; in the genocide trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been like asking a Muslim court in former Yugoslavia to try a Serbian genocide suspect,&quot; said Chris Nzabandora of the exiled RFD opposition party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exiled opposition leader Seth Sendashonga said in the RFD statement that the Rwandan government had published a list of more than 1,900 people thought to be responsible for the genocide of more than half a million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Those found guilty of organizing, planning and carrying out massacres and rapes face death by firing squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While acknowledging that &quot;many&quot; of the people named had in fact been involved in &quot;preparing and executing the massacres,&quot; he said the list contained many errors, and noted that &quot;not a single soldier, official, militant or sympathiser&quot; of the Tutsi-led authorities, which put an end to the Hutu bloodbath by sweeping to power in July 1994, was on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Hutu groups have also expressed grave concern at the legal process insisting that the minority Tutsi-dominated authorities cannot guarantee fair, impartial trials for their erstwhile Hutu adversaries. With the large numbers awaiting trial in Rwanda's overcrowded jails, the process looks set to last several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure has been swelled by the arrest of some 5,4600 other new suspects who recently returned to Rwanda among more than one million refugees who had fled the country in 1994 into exile in eastern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire and Tanzania. Most of the detainees had returned from Tanzania, due to the fact that &quot;genocide organizers who were based in Zairean camps escaped, while those sheltering in Tanzania were obliged to go back to Rwanda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By December 31, more than 480,000 Rwandan refugees had returned home from Tanzania, leaving some 50,000 still in the country, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in Tanzania, numbering about 530,000, began a mass exodus towards their homeland after Tanzanian authorities ordered the camps, which they had occupied for two and a half years, to be closed before December 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to send back the refugees followed the massive return to Rwanda of close to 500,000 refugees in eastern Zaire, after fighting broke out there between local Tutsi rebels, known as the Banyamulenge, and Zairean forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one and a half months, Rwanda, whose population totalled 7 million before the 1994 genocide, has 'recovered' more than one million Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees fled Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide, which only ended with the seizure of power in Kigali by the RPF. But after Tanzania announced its decision to close the camps, tens of thousands of refugees fled in the opposite direction from Rwanda in an effort to escape forced repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Tanzanian military forces blocked routes and the Rwandan refugees slowly began leaving their hiding places in the forests. With swollen feet and fear in their bellies, they began the long trek back to the frontier post of Rusumo, which they had passed in the opposite direction back in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, UNHCR officials still believe that hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees remained stranded in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since November, some 1.3 million Rwandans had returned from exile after fleeing the 1994 civil war -- nearly 720,000 from eastern Zaire and more than 480,000 from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued in Geneva on January 7, the UNHCR said that of those who remained in eastern Zaire, 150,000 were clustered at Shabunda, 120,000 at Tingi Tingi and 60,000 at Amisi, but many others are unaccounted for. &quot; Yesterday (January 6), 4,500 emerged from a previously unknown location north- west of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province,&quot; UNHCR's spokeswoman Pamela O'Toole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tingi Tingi camp is thought to be under the control of Hutu Interahamwe extremists, complicating the task for refugees who want to return but are intimidated into remaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN agency said options to help ease their plight included creating humanitarian land corridors, moving refugees to more accessible areas and airlifting them home.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS - A year after worldwide publicity in the wake of the execution of the Ogoni author and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others in November 1995, the plight of the minority tribes of Nigeria's Delta region seems to have become obscure. But an incisive new report by the World Council of Churches (WCC) shows that repression characterised by torture, rapes and looting besides massive pollution of the environment with oil continues unabated in the Ogoni people's homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year after the military authorities in Nigeria executed author and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa and nine others - all leaders of the Ogoni community Ken following a dubious judicial process, a quiet state of siege continues to exist in Ogoniland of River State Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intimidation, rape, arrests, torture, shooting, looting by soldiers and mobile police (called 'kill-and-go') continue to occur,&quot; concludes a World Council of Churches (WCC) report entitled &quot;Ogoni - The Struggle Continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Published by the WCC's Unit III - Justice Peace and Creation, it was authored by Dr. Deborah Robinson of the WCC Programme to Combat Racism who visited Ogoniland in early 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Robinson, who told APS her visit to Ogoni was neither as &quot;part of a government sponsored fact-finding mission nor part of a Shell- sponsored fact- finding tour,&quot; carried out interviews with individuals in the actual line of fire of a highly repressive security and administrative apparatus. She was also able to witness the massive environmental pollution that resulted from Anglo-Dutch Shell Corporations bungled operations in the region over a period of 30 years. Officially, the petroleum giant pulled out of Ogoniland in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, asserts Dr. Robinson in the face of denials by Anglo- Dutch Shell, the company continues to pump oil from some wells in the region as evidenced by flares (excess gas being burnt). A Shell spokesman emphatically denied this specific charge by Dr. Robinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is not in doubt is that a vast array of pipework criss-crosses the land and is the source of leakages that have dumped oil into waterways and destroyed millions of acres of arable land. Not only are food crops devastated but farmers are separated from their farms by leaky pipes which also cause large scale health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo-Dutch Shell Corporation which has pumped out of Ogoniland petroleum worth some $30,000 million since they began operations in the area in 1958, has never paid compensation for the 500,000 people of Ogoniland whose natural occupation-farming and fishing-has been devastated and millions rendered destitute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of WCC's Unit III Rev. Dr. Sam Kobia says the report is not mere propaganda but contains hard evidence of what is happening on the ground in Ogoniland. Rev. Kobia challenges the international community to show solidarity with the suffering people of Ogoniland by actually doing something to ameliorate their situation. &quot;The time to do something is now,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Robinson's report makes a total of 28 recommendations to help ease the plight of the Ogonis. Among these the report calls on the Nigerian authorities to restore democracy, release the 19 Ogonis imprisoned as a result of the activities with the MOSOP (Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People) as well as other political detainees. It also calls for the release for proper burial of the bodies of the nine Ogonis - including that of the MOSOP leader Ken Saro-Wiwa, who were executed on November 9, 1995. The WCC report also reproduces the late Saro-Wiwa's closing statement to the military- appointed tribunal which sentenced him and eight others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also urges Anglo-Dutch Shell to accept responsibility for the oil spillages and oil pollution that have occurred in the areas under its operations as well as allow inspection by independent agencies for clean up activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Shell is urged to pressurize the Nigerian government to release the imprisoned Ogonis and guarantee the democratic process in Ogoniland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WCC is urged to establish a fund for the defence and assistance of political detainees and to organise the collection of emergency medical supplies for political prisoners and two poorly equipped clinics in Ogoniland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like in 1995, the WCC in December 1996 announced a $13,000 to the MOSOP under the council's Special Fund to Combat Racism. The 1995 allocation to the Ogoni group represented the largest share of a US$100,000 fund targeting 12 groups worldwide. The only beneficiary from Africa then, MOSOP would use the money to handle the many humanitarian aspects of their smuggle. &quot;This grant is another visible symbol of the WCC's commitment not only to the Ogoni but also to oppressed indigenous people everywhere,&quot; said a statement by the council then. Last December's grant is the third that the group has received from WCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Robinson report will be discussed at a UNIT III Commission meeting in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi from January 13 to 19, 1997 and requests for WCC action will be passed to the annual Central Committee which convenes in September 1997. Former WCC General Secretary Philip Potter and incumbent Dr.  Konrad Raisser are attending the Nairobi meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a report of the International Struggle Meeting on Nigeria organised by the WCC from November 20 to 24, 1996, consolidated the recommendations made in Dr. Robinson's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the outset the deliberations reflected on the centrality of the churches' role in achieving transformation in Nigeria, a nation with an estimated population of nearly 100 million people, about 45 per cent of whom are Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting noted that the repression of the Ogoni people has been used by the Nigerian government to intimidate others struggling for justice in Nigeria. &quot;This terror needs to be countered by giving the Ogoni crisis special focus. The Ogoni Struggle is a non-violent people's movement against powerful forces of repression, marginalisation and injustice,&quot; participants stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other recommendations made by the International Strategy Meeting were directed at specific church institutions. Among others, the Christian Council of Nigeria (CCN) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) were urged to support the Ogoni Council of Churches and to strengthen its ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CAN/CNN are urged to make a public statement calling for the release of the Ogoni 19 and to use all available means to advance the cause of the Ogoni people. The CCN is also encouraged to revive its activities in the field of peace, justice and development and to work with existing human rights training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and civic education programmes including those initiated by the Catholic Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both CCN and CAN and other Christian groups are further encouraged to convene a workshop in Nigeria on the Church's role in societies in crisis, drawing upon the experience of the South African Council of Churches (SACC), the Institute of Contextual Theology, and the WCC's Urban Rural Mission, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recommendations further request WCC to urge all member churches, regional ecumenical bodies and national councils of churches to exert pressure upon the government of Nigeria. Emphasis is on guaranteeing of basic human rights and the return to the rule of law in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And among other recommendations, the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) in Nairobi is asked to distribute information on Nigeria to its member churches. The AACC capacity towards that end will have to be strengthened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An AACC delegation is encouraged to visit the churches and representatives of civil society in Nigeria, increasing the awareness of WCC member churches of the crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy meeting recommended a follow-up meeting on Nigeria to include an expanded number of partners from Nigeria and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the WCC report on Ogoniland, General Secretary Rev. Jose Chipenda said AACC is committed to implementing the recommendations spelt out in line with its pastoral mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to APS in an interview here on January 9, Rev. Chipenda said AACC's role in helping resolve the crisis in Ogoniland will also depend on the input from the Nigerian churches, particularly the member churches of the continental body, and financial commitment on the part of the ecumenical partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told APS that AACC had already written to the General Secretary of the CCN, seeking to know how the continental organisation can collaborate with the Council of Churches in Nigeria to help end the crisis in Ogoniland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Chipenda said he also looks forward to the participation of Nigerian churches in the AACC International Affairs Board meeting scheduled for February in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOGADISHU - Somali's clan factions have signed a major peace accord after more than a month of tough negotiations in neighbouring Ethiopia, but two key groups have refused to join the peace bandwagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the peace accord, signed on January 3 in Sodere, a tourist complex 200 kilometres east of Addis Ababa, Somali clan factions set up a National Salvation Council aimed at paving the way for a transitional government in a bid to end years of bloodshed and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Somali warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid's United Somali Congress/Somali National Alliance (USC/SNA) faction was not among the 26 groups which took part in more than four weeks of tough negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a &quot;solemn declaration&quot; the clan chiefs urged Aideed and another absent warlord Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, who heads a self-declared government in Somaliland, in northern Somalia, to join their peace efforts to end chaos which has crippled the country since the fall of the former dictator Mohammad Siad Barre in January 1991, with no form of government as rival factions battled it out for control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the declaration, the clan chiefs appointed a 41-member council and a national executive committee in the presence of observers from the Organization of African Unity and the Inter-Government Authority on Development (IGAD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration acknowledged &quot;our inability so far to arrest the conflict&quot; as the &quot;main obstacle to progress in Somalia is the lack of a central authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aideed took over as clan chief after his father General Mohamed Farah Aideed died in August from wounds incurred in a battle for the Medina district of south Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He considers himself the president of Somalia after his father, who set up a government unrecognized by the other factions, was declared interim president for three years at a conference of his supporters in Mogadishu in June 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aideed's main rival for control of the USC/SNA faction, Osman Hassan Ali Atto, did join the talks in Addis Ababa launched on November 22, thanks to an Ethiopian mediation, and ended on January 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council aims to hold a new &quot;conference of national reconciliation&quot; in Bossaso in the north-east before setting up a provisional government and a transitional authority. A five-strong co-chairmanship will head the national executive committee and will &quot;act and speak&quot; for the council and will be in charge of coordinating emergency aid and rehabilitation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Salvation Council's mandate included to restore peace and stability, to boost reconciliation efforts between the clans, to draw up a transition charter and to put in place a central transitional authority or provisional central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also present at the talks was Ali Mahdi Mohamed, a long and bitter rival of General Aideed's, whose forces control north Mogadishu, and who with Osman Atto as well as clan heads Abdulkadir Mohamed Aden, Aboudlahi Yussuf and Aden Abdoulahi Nur will form the co- chairmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on January 8, Aideed's Interior Secretary Mohamed Kanyare Afrah, scoffed at the invitations to his faction to join the peace bandwagon and made it known that those who went to Ethiopia for the peace conference committed a crime against his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanyare Afrah warned that when they return to Somalia, they will be detained and prosecuted for their action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a national representative government supported by most Somali factions,&quot; Kanyare Afrah said, and characterised those who went to Ethiopia as &quot;invented factions, splinter groups and elements who carry messages for foreigners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanyare himself appealed to the factions which went to Ethiopia to abandon their ways and join the government of Hussein Aideed. The leader of the self- declared Republic of Somaliland was also not expected to heed the call, as the north and north-west Somali territory has long refused to consider itself part of Somalia and its ongoing clan warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogadishu has been the scene of renewed fighting in past weeks, as Aideed and Osman Atto's rival forces battle for control of the southern part of the city. A green line already divides the capital in a bid to separate Aideed's forces from those of Ali Mahdi's Somali Salvation Alliance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE - Thousands of Christians from various churches in Zimbabwe thronged the United Church of Christ in Zimbabwe (UCCZ) here on January 5, 1997 to witness the installation of Rev. Murombedzi Kuchera as President of the church, according to a press release from the Ecumenical Documentation and Information Centre for Eastern and Southern Africa (EDICESA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDICESA says the ceremony which was punctuated by music from popular gospel singer Mechanic Manyeruke and various UCCZ choirs, was attended by among others, heads of denominations of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) member churches, the general secretaries of South African Council of Churches (SACC) and Council of Swaziland Churches (CSC), lay Christians and ecumenical organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 48 years old, Rev. Kuchera becomes the youngest president of his church although he brings to the Church more than 20 years of ecumenical experience.  He replaces the outgoing President Rev. Watson Makata Mkwakwami who leaves the office after serving for 16 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Kuchera, a well known religious leader in Zimbabwe, in the region as well as internationally, leaves the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, an organisation that he has led as chief executive for the last 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979, Rev. Kuchera was a member of the ZCC Executive Committee and the Reconciliation Committee. He attended the historic 1979 Lancaster House constitutional talks which led to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was appointed General Secretary of ZCC in August 1982 and his first task was familiarization with the work of ZCC, the ecumenical donor partners and the World Council of Churches (WCC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only nine members of staff when Rev. Kuchera assumed the leadership of ZCC in 1982, the council has expanded and now boasts of 70 members of staff.  It currently has 15 immovable properties with a high potential of becoming a self-reliant organisation. UCCZ's new leader also worked hard and helped ZCC to purchase the Kentucky Airport Hotel in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the leadership of Rev. Kuchera, ZCC was able to start the Ecumenical Human Resources Development Programme, which is now the largest programme of ZCC and the Justice, Peace and Reconciliation Programme which is the most vibrant and progressive programme of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other programmes, Rev. Kuchera also initiated the Mission and Evangelism Programme, the ZCC regional Office in Zimbabwe's second largest city, Bulawayo and the Endowment Fund for self-reliance of the churches and the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the regional scene, Rev. Kuchera helped to establish FOCCESA, which is the 12-member Fellowship of Christian Councils in Eastern and Southern Africa and its communication body, the Ecumenical Documentation and Information Centre for Eastern and Southern Africa (EDICESA). FOCCESA comprises national councils of churches in Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rev. Kuchera is highly regarded in Zimbabwe and is one of the national opinion makers and a point of reference,&quot; said ZCC President Rev. Enos Chomutiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Rev. Kuchera will be missed by his fellow members of staff but added that he was grateful that ZCC could still benefit from Kuchera's wide experience through his participation in the work of the council as a member of the Executive Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his appointment as President of UCCZ, Rev. Kuchera noted that overwhelming support and prayers from the church people was a great source of inspiration and strength in his acceptance of the challenging ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I shall try my level best, God is my help, to maintain the confidence the people showed in me through listening to the voice of God as He speaks through and during my term of office. It is my fervent hope that through listening to God's people, we shall together come up with a common understanding and shared vision of the UCCZ,&quot; said Rev. Kuchera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president said his main concern would be promoting human dignity and sustainable communities through propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, sharing available resources, practical actions of solidarity, human resources development, capacity building and empowerment of the poor. He also promised to work towards uplifting the marginalised, women and youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Kuchera noted the need for a church that works towards elimination of poverty through entrepreneurship training as one of the means to ensure that every Zimbabwean has three meals a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his leadership envisages a community of believers which is gender sensitive and promotes the status of women in decision making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The women have to be on the driving seat and not participate simply as passengers. Therefore the church will commit itself to initiate activities which will help women to find their proper places and roles in their families, at their workplaces, in their churches, and in their communities,&quot; said Rev.  Kuchera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On youth, Rev. Kuchera said these are an integral part of today's society and tomorrow's community. He noted that the youth's role in mission and evangelism is very important for Church's growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Church will initiate participatory programmes where the youth will learn the strategies for self reliance. They should be handled with care and raised in our families and not in the streets of our cities,&quot; said the UCCZ leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the UCCZ will work with Government in the programmes of agriculture, health education, vocational skills training for survival and rural development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted that the UCCZ will keep its ecumenical spirit and participate in the ecumenical foram at the highest level and promote ecumenical programmes initiated by ZCC, All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), World Council of Churches (WCC), interdenominational organisations and other churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Kuchera is married to Betty and they have seven children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI - Catholic bishops meeting here have accused some African politicians of exploiting the rich African ethnicity for their individual needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clergy, who met here from December 18 to 21, 1996 to deliberate on the crisis in the Great Lakes region, noted that &quot;ethnicity becomes a worst menace when political or private interest transform it into an ideology and instrument of conquest and power basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ideology, by means of internal and external alliances, along with the sordid arms trade, engenders conflicts and feeds a spiral of discrimination, exclusion and violence that leads to massacres and even genocide, the clergy stressed in their statement issued at the end of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was organised by the Vatican, under Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, who heads the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. It brought together 27 delegates, drawn from Burundi, Zaire, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and the Vatican. They included both priests, bishops, archbishops and cardinals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic clergy said disastrous effects of ethnicity are quite evident.  In a subtle way it penetrates individuals as well as cultures and institutions, they stressed in their statement, adding that &quot;even members of the church are affected by this contamination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on a good note, many sons and daughters of the church have accepted to offer the supreme sacrifice of their life to defend and save individuals of another ethnic group, the clergy's statement further said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that ethnocentric ideology is contrary to the gospel, they noted; &quot;That is why we are determined to step up our efforts to build up a church which is the family of God, characterised by &quot;conviviality&quot; and where all its sons and daughters are recognised as such and respected in their equal dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They thus called on churches to get involved in programmes to educate the people of God to take up responsibilities in the society in accordance with the social doctrine of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their meeting discussed four themes namely; The gospel as facing up to the ethnocentric ideology; Church's mission of reconciliation; Church as a voice of those enduring hardships and Solidarity between the churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the mission of reconciliation of the church, for example, the clergy said the church urgently needs agents of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a certain sense every baptized person must consider himself (or herself) a 'minister of reconciliation', the clergymen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the church as the voice of those enduring hardships, the clergy appealed to the political decision-makers to urgently work at alleviating sufferings of all kinds, &quot;which befall our populations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However any lasting solution to these human dramatic situations must include the promotion of the rule of law, they stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They suggested that a joint ecumenical effort will give the witness of the church a wider field for providing comfort and taking action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops also expressed concern on the hardships imposed on the people, both lay and clergy, citing the brutal death of bishops in Burundi and Rwanda.  &quot;We express our anguish about Bishop Phocas Nikwigize, the emeritus bishop of Ruhengeri (Rwanda), who was a refugee at Goma (Zaire) and who has disappeared nearly a month ago,&quot; the clergymen further said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on solidarity between churches, the Catholic bishops hailed Pope John Paul II, sister churches in Africa and the whole world and non- governmental agencies &quot;for all the concrete activities through which they have expressed their sympathy and solidarity towards our churches and our peoples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Pope in his Christmas message, expressed concern over the crisis in the Great Lakes region. &quot;Can we forget Africa? At the heart of the continent, around the Great Lakes, one of the cruelest dramas in its history is being played out, while the international community looks on with indifference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thousands upon thousands of persons, our brothers and sisters, are wandering about, a prey to fear, famine and disease,&quot; the Catholic pontiff stated in the message, adding that &quot;the number of refugees and displaced persons no doubt runs into the hundreds of thousands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in his New Year message, coinciding with the World Day of Peace Communication celebrated by Catholics worldwide on January 1, the Pope challenged the church among other institutions to continue working for peace despite the many odds that plague such intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources within the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Kenya Office, an estimated 1,432 Rwandan refugees had returned from Zaire between January 1 and 6 this year through Gisenyi while another 1,325 had also returned to Rwanda between January 1 and 5 through Cyangugu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to portray the actual situation within the Great Lakes region right now but definitely we are aware of quite a number of Rwandan refugees returning to their country,&quot; a spokesperson at the office, told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesperson also disclosed that an estimated 120,000 refugees are said to have fled the designated camps in Eastern Zaire, the battle field inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up to now, the information we have is that these people are on their own, somewhere inside Zaire, where we are told there could be a daily death rate of between 11 to 15 persons. The issue is being dealt by our Kisangani Office in Zaire,&quot; she told APS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS - The Anglican bishop in charge of Nigeria's Delta region has died from his injuries after being shot and wounded in an attack on his official residence, the pro-government Daily Times reported on December 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Samuel Elenwo, who was shot several times in the back, and a female guest, who had several of her fingers blown off, were brought to a hospital at Port Harcourt, but died on December 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources cited in the Nigerian press said six bandits attacked the bishop during a dinner with several guests at his home on the night of December 27. The bishop was shot while trying to flee the melee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bandits left after pillaging the residence. Quoting family sources, the newspaper said the assassins fled the scene following the attack after pillaging the residence but without demanding any money or taking away anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for the attack remained a mystery, but the newspaper quoted sources saying the bishop may have been assassinated for his family's support for one of the factions disputing the traditional title in the southern Rivers state municipality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement of the bishop's death came the same day as two Nigerian private newspapers voted violence in Nigeria as their &quot;Man of the Year,&quot; an exceptional choice because the press usually nominates individuals who have taken major steps affecting humanity for the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Day and Vanguard newspapers announced that their boards of editors had respectively, chosen &quot;Mr. Assassin&quot; and &quot;Violence&quot; as man of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many prominent, as well as ordinary Nigerians, have been brutally killed by &quot;Mr. Assassin, that faceless, nameless, unidentifiable personality who leaves no clues&quot; after striking, This Day wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This beast, this spirit, kills with bravado and daring and ruthlessness, in the process defying the agents of law and order, breaking every security cordon, and hitting his target noiselessly but with professional plan,&quot; added the daily, which carried a drawing of a masked assassin, gun to the ready, on its front page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its five-page report, the Vanguard listed a litany of violent events which ended in tragedy. One noted victim was Ibrahim, the first child of General Sani Abacha, who died with 13 others when a presidential plane crashed last January near Kano, northern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another victim listed by the newspaper, which also carried a drawing of a masked assassin on its front page, holding a gun and a human skull, was Kudiratu Abiola, the wife of detained millionaire politician, Chief Moshood Abiola, who is widely believed to have won the June 1993 presidential election. She was killed after unknown gunmen opened fire on her car last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 18, the son of Nigeria's former Justice Minister Olu Onagoruwa was slain in a robbery at his home in the capital, the Guardian daily reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said unidentified assailants broke into the home of Toyin Onagoruwa, demanded money, and then took him outside where they shot him twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior Onagoruwa was Justice Minister in military junta leader General Sani Abacha's first government, shortly after the latter assumed power in November 1993, but was sacked in September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1994 for expressing reservations about a wave of draconian decrees from Abacha limiting press and individual freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A score of prominent people have been gunned down by unknown assassins this year alone. Security agents are yet to solve any of these cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE - Media, information and education personnel from various organisations meeting here on January 6 for a brainstorming session on the need to ban landmines in Zimbabwe and other countries in the region, have called on both print and electronic media to inform the public on the dangers of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting convened by the Ecumenical Documentation and Information Center for Eastern and Southern Africa (EDICESA) forms the publicity and education committee which is part of Zimbabwe's Campaign to Ban Landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release by EDICESA here said participants who included print and electronic media journalists, librarians, teachers and trade union representatives, focused their debate on the need to clear areas infested with landmines, policies relating to the financing of clearance, compensation of victims of explosions and ways of involving affected populations in mine- clearing programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also the aim of the campaign to influence policy about the use, production, stockpiling and trade in landmines as well as public awareness and education.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants noted the need to launch educational campaigns, involving ordinary men, women and children, particularly in mine- infested areas in the country, said the EDICESA release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting suggested that for the campaign to be effective it would be necessary to involve the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) public relations office.  According to ZNA statistics, there are 2.5 million landmines on Zimbabwean soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the victims of landmines are mostly children of school going- age, the publicity and education committee called for workshops with headmasters and teachers on the subject of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called on the Ministry of Education and Culture to disseminate information on landmines to schools and to the public at large through the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC)'s educational channel, Radio Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also felt that the whole country should be involved in the fight against landmines and suggested that pamphlets in English and vernacular languages should be produced and circulated to people living side by side with landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is need to encourage the setting up of landmines' committees in affected zones so that people in those areas can meet regularly and exchange information. Whatever resolution they can come up with can be channeled to the right authorities,&quot; said a reporter with Horizon Magazine, George Mangwiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that people, particularly in the rural areas do not feel free to release information on landmines to strangers although some of them have &quot;all the information&quot; that could be useful to any demining programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realizing the strategic position of the Church, the participants called on pastors particularly those serving in mine-infested areas to dedicate time to this critical area, so that together with the people, solutions could be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Awareness programmes should be intensified in areas like Chipinge (in the south-east near the border with Mozambique), where anti- personnel landmines are indiscriminately planted. The growing populations in these areas need information on the danger of landmines to minimize death and injuries,&quot; said Gorden Simango, a documentalist at EDICESA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the participants felt the problem of landmines should not only be the responsibility of government and other structures in the country but the international community should also assist with financing demining activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all, it is the developed countries that manufacture most of these landmines that are killing people and livestock,&quot; said one participant. Thus the media were also challenged to sensitize the international community on the need to assist Zimbabwe and other countries in the region to get rid of the hidden killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that out of the more than 110 million landmines planted in various parts of the world, 30 million are in Africa, most of them in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants expressed concern that two countries in the region -- South Africa and Zimbabwe -- have produced landmines. They called for a total ban on manufacturing, use, selling, exporting and stockpiling of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)'s 12-member countries, only two do not have a problem of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why individuals, governmental and non-governmental organisations in Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe have set up national campaigns to ban landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their findings are expected to be shared in Maputo, Mozambique in February 1997 during an international conference which is expected to go along way towards achieving a landmines-free zone in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA - Only 5,000 guns out of the expected 60,000 have so far been surrendered in the on-going disarmament process in Liberia, Major-General Victor Malu, the Nigerian commander of the West African peace keeping force, ECOMOG, has confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Abuja-Accord signed in the Nigerian capital late last year by the warring factions in the Liberian conflict, the disarmament process which began on November 22 should be completed by January 31. General Malu was however still hopeful that the deadline would be met. &quot;As a matter of fact the fighters have shown a lot of interest in disarming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that there is no food in the vocation centres where the fighters are supposed to congregate following the disarmament exercise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded that the last two weeks of December had seen a drastic reduction in the flow of weapons in the disarmament exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on January 6, the factional leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) Charles Taylor disputed the prediction that 60,000 guns were expected to be reclaimed from the fighters, saying &quot;not all fighters in Liberia carried guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one of his rivals for the leadership of Liberia, George Bowen of the Liberian Peace Council (LPC) has suggested that dishonesty on the part of some factional leaders was the cause of the slow pace of the weapons reclamation exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late December 1996, the Catholic Bishop of Monrovia, Michael Francis issued a pastoral letter entitled &quot;Free Fair and Democratic Elections&quot; in which he expressed concern at the slow rate of recovery of weapons from the fighters. At the time only about 700 guns had been given up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Francis says unless the fundamental process of disarmament is completed to the satisfaction of all concerned, there is real danger that the elections due in May this year will be constrained by intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is intimidation, the elections will not be free, fair nor legitimate&quot;, says the Catholic leader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS - Lagos' Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Olubunmi Okogie, has deplored what he described as the &quot;vandalisation&quot; by government of schools and other institutions with missionary roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Christmas message delivered on December 24, Okogie said that unless something was done to retrace lost values, the road to peace and happiness in Nigeria and the world might remain a long one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roman Catholic Church in Nigeria has consistently demanded the return of schools, hospitals and other institutions taken over from missionary and voluntary agencies by the government 20 years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okogie, a renowned critic of the military government that rules Nigeria, also deplored unemployment and the lack of basic amenities such as good water, roads and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also spoke of the need for government to bring about democracy through the establishment of justice, love and peace all over Nigeria, and called on public officials to resist corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they resist such temptations, if they keep the good of the people they serve before them, history will tell of their heroism,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week later, Archbishop Okogie reiterated that Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha needed selfless advisers if he is to redress social ills plaguing Africa's most populous nation with population estimates put at more than 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If his advisers had come to his aid and offered him advice that will benefit the general populace and not their own selfish and sectional interests, some of the social ills that now plague the nation would have been arrested,&quot; Okogie said in his New Year message, released on December 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okogie said that those who come to power unexpectedly but prefer to use their powers to either destroy, amass wealth or profound unworkable theories, make life difficult for many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cleric also condemned those campaigning for the legalization of abortion, adding that the two main religions in the country -- Islam and Christianity -- &quot;agree on the illicitness of legalizing abortion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the government to create employment for jobless school graduates as well as help bring down the prices of vital food items which, according to him, are currently beyond the reach of many people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian legislators have recommended that a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment be established, as a way of protecting the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislators resolved, at the country's fist workshop on Environmental Education for legislators, that parliament enact laws to regulate, monitor and implement the use of the natural resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Laws should be introduced to provide a price tag on industries who pollute the environment,&quot; they said. &quot;By laws should also be introduced by councils to ensure that every village have pit latrines as part of clean environment programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In understanding the existing practices that compound environmental degradation, and the constraints in promoting environmental education in formal and informal ways, the legislators recommended that the Ministry of Environment be classified as a priority ministry, to ensure that more funds are allocated to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop -- held last week, in Siavonga, south of Lusaka -- was attended by 28 parliamentarians from each of the country's nine provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was aimed at creating an in-depth understanding of environmental issues, as well as elaborating measures to mitigate the negative effects of environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia loses an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 hectares of forests each year.  Because of this rate of exploitation, officials say, the country is likely to experience a shortage of forest resources in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other environmental degradation cited at the workshop was lose of soil productivity which is causing extensive land abandonment because of current practices in agriculture and animal husbandry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some parts of Zambia, soil loss on cultivated land is estimated at between 12.5 and 20 tonnes per hectare annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists observe that through deforestation, illegal hunting and over-fishing, a number of species in Zambia may soon be lost completely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - On December 5, 1995, in a village in Maputo Province, Mozambique, several children were collecting scrap metal to sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the bits they found was a land mine. When the metal was weighed on a scale in the market, the land mine exploded, instantly killing eight children.  Three others died in hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This happened three years after the peace agreement ended the 16-year civil war. Since then, in Maputo Province alone, 98 people have stepped on land mines. Out of these, 68 were children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every Southern African country, except Lesotho and Mauritius, has had people wounded or killed by land mines. Officials estimate that at least 20 million of these devices have been laid in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weapons lie hidden and awaiting the footsteps of a woman gathering firewood or a child fetching water. Long after a conflict ends, land mines threaten villagers, render farmland unusable, and disrupt transport and market systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To end the carnage, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines has tried to get an immediate and permanent end to their use, manufacture, export and stockpiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization's next conference, to making all of Southern Africa mine- free, will be held in Maputo from from Feb. 25 to 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 17 countries most severely plagued by antipersonnel mines, seven are in Africa. Three of these -- Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe -- are in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two nations in the sub-region, South Africa and Zimbabwe, have manufactured land mines. Angola has between eight million and 20 million mines in its soil -- more than one for each of its 10 million people. In Mozambique, about one million land mines remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizers of the forthcoming conference said Monday that the gathering would consist of speeches, panel discussions, workshops, papers as well as visits to demining sites and training centers, prosthetics and rehabilitation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants would review the scale of the regional land mine problem, its socio-economic consequences and how these weapons affect women, refugees, the internally displaced and returning populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also examine case studies of Angola and Mozambique and hear the experience of land mine survivors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The Ghana government has agreed to transfer to Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited (AGC) government's interests, or rights to an interest, in the company's assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghana News Agency, which reported the deal Monday, did not say when the agreement was signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it said that the interests were a 10-percent government share holding in the Ghanaian-Australian Goldfields (GAG), a 10-percent shareholding in Cluff Resources Ghana Limited and a right to acquire 10- percent interest in Ashanti Gold's Bibiani project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total consideration of the transfers are valued at 15.9 million U.S.  dollars. Of this, 13.9 million dollars will be settled by the issue of new AGC shares at a price of 13.81 dollars. This is equal to the average of AGC ordinary share price for five dealing days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GAG is a 70-percent subsidiary of AGC, acquired through completion of the merger of AGC and Golden Shamrock Mines Limited. Cluff Resources Ghana Limited's principal asset is the Ayanfuri Mine in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government currently holds 18.6 percent of the issued share capital of AGC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and AGC said &quot;on completion of the transfers, the government will hold 19.4 percent of the issued ordinary share capital of Ashanti which will stand at 108,059,481 shares.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Except in limited circumstances, or with the prior consent of Ashanti, the government has agreed not to dispose of the new Ashanti ordinary shares being issued as consideration for the Transfer for a period of 12 months,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government and AGC anticipate that the new AGC ordinary shares will be admitted to listing on the London Stock Exchange on January 20, at the same time as the transfers are completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listings will be obtained on the Ghana, New York, Toronto, Zimbabwe and Australian Stock Exchanges shortly afterwards. AGC is already listed on all these exchanges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Well trained personnel, rather than sufficient natural resources, hold the key to Africa's economic growth, a leading academic said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Benneh, who is president of the Association of African Universities, said this in Lusaka, Zambia, at the opening of the assocition's ninth general conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited Japan, Singapore and South Korea as some of the countries which had applied brain power to join the club of developed nations, even though they are endowed with scant natural resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the challenge that faces African universities and this is also the reason why African governments have to invest more in training and research,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African universities, he said, needed to increase research and help society find solutions to problems like hunger, disease and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to reach these types of goals, he said, could make African universities lose public confidence in the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the same conference, the secretary-general of the Association of International Universities, Franz Eberhard, said that it was crucial for developing countries to break out of downward spiral of dependence and of underdevelopment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, too, said that governments had a crucial role of funding higher education and research, as well as creating the right atmosphere to enable African scholars to deliver what was expected of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who officially opened the conference Monday, appealed to demographers, economists and other social scientists to examine, critically, some of the current theories which he said were alien to African conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said that academics should develop come up with theories that more correctly explained Africa's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week-long seminar has drawn participants from almost all African countries, including representatives from international organizations and donor community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association was created to encourage contacts between its 142 members and the international academic world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - The following Press Statement is attributable to Martin Griffiths, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional embargo on Burundi declared on July 31, 1996 continues to impose severe restrictions on the ability of international humanitarian organizations to provide aid to the country's most vulnerable populations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 6, the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) authorized international humanitarian organizations to import fuel for emergency humanitarian relief. The fuel imported was sufficient for only one month of operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since November 18, international humanitarian organizations have made several joint requests for a new allocation of fuel to the RSCC. To date, no authorization to import new supplies of fuel has been received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, both UN and NGO fuel reserves are virtually depleted. Essential programs have already been reduced. Agencies are now being forced to consider reducing their emergency relief operations even further. If a favourable decision by the RSCC is not taken immediately, agencies will be unable to provide life-sustaining assistance to hundreds of thousands of extremely vulnerable people in Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army has admitted killing 126 Hutu refugees on Friday who returned to the country from Tanzania and tried to escape from a detention centre. Army spokesman Lt-Col Isaie Nibizi said seven soldiers had been arrested in connection with the shootings, in the northeast province of Muyingi, and would be charged in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential spokesman Jean-Luc Ndizeye also said the government was probing the incident and more details would be released in the course of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN official in Burundi told Reuters that 120 Burundian Hutu refugees accused of fomenting trouble in the camps in Tanzania had been sent back to Burundi over the weekend. He said they were expelled from Tanzania's Kitale camp after in-fighting between Burundian extremist Hutus from the Palipehutu organisation and the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD).  Reuters quoted eyewitnesses as saying the army massacred 83 Hutu civilians near Rutegama in Muramvya province last weekend, but presidential spokesman Ndizeye said he had heard nothing about the incident.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Burundian official said more than 200,000 civilians had been grouped into special camps in the troubled provinces of Cibitoke, Bubanza, Karuzi and Muramvya so that the army could differentiate between innocent civilians and Hutu rebels. Frederic Kazungu, chief of staff at the ministry for displaced people and refugee repatriation, admitted that conditions at the Karuzi camps in particular were not ideal, placing the blame on regional economic sanctions imposed by Burundi's neighbours last July. &quot;Normally we should provide them with help by supplying them with food, medicine and plastic sheets, but we have had coordination problems with aid workers,&quot; he said. &quot; Because of the embargo, aid from the main organisations has arrived only in dribs and drabs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN today warned of serious impediments to relief operations in Burundi unless the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) authorises the importation of more fuel supplies. A statement released by the office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes region said the ongoing regional economic embargo was severely hampering the ability of aid organisations to help needy people in Burundi. The fuel imports authorised by the RSCC in September lasted only one month and subsequent requests for new fuel allocations have not been met. The statement stressed that both UN and NGO fuel reserves were now virtually depleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian government has set a deadline of 18 January for all Burundian refugees living outside the camps to return to them. In a statement issued yesterday, the government also urged Burundians &quot;who are ready to go home&quot; to do so, because the situation in Burundi was &quot;not as threatening as reported by certain quarters&quot;. Refugees from camps in the Kigoma, Tabora, Rukwa and Kagera regions had spread to local villages and towns, the statement said. It added that 30,000 people had already returned home voluntarily to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian government also announced the closure of camps in the northwest areas of Karagwe, Milepa, Biharamulo and Ngara formerly inhabited by Rwandan refugees, most of whom had now returned home. Refugees who fled the camps and are still hiding out in forests or towns will be hunted down by the authorities and legal action taken against them. Zaireans entering the Kigoma region are not recognised as refugees and must register immediately in the camps so they can be assisted to return home, the government stated.  Reuters quoted a UNHCR official as saying some 5,000 refugees had arrived in Tanzania last week, fleeing the war in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN on Friday reported a total of 5,837 Burundian refugees currently in Rwanda, gathered in three groups. There were 707 refugees at the Musange Transit Centre in Butare prefecture who arrived with the mass influx of Rwandan returnees from Goma, Zaire, last November. The biggest group, 3,678 refugees, were at Kibangire camp in Cyangugu prefecture. They began arriving in June, fleeing the fighting in Burundi's Cibitoke province. Another 1,452 refugees were inhabiting the Kigeme camp in Gikongoro prefecture where they had fled in the aftermath of the assassination of Burundi president Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993. The Rwandan government believes there is no longer any need for refugee camps in Rwanda and the Burundians should now return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) today resumed the trial of the first defendant, former mayor of Taba, Jean-Paul Akayesu. The trial adjourned Friday after hearing testimony from the first prosecution witness, a Tutsi woman known simply as &quot;K&quot; to protect her identity. She narrated how Akayesu had ordered the killings of Tutsis in the commune of Taba, Gitarama prefecture, where she had worked as his accountant. The ICTR's witness protection measures include no photographing, filming or sketching of the witnesses. Akayesu today personally cross-examined the witness but requested an adjournment to prepare his questions. The court agreed to suspend work until tomorrow morning. Meanwhile, Akayesu has also requested a change of lawyer for the third time since his trial began in October last year. However the tribunal's registrar Adronico Adede refused to allow any further delays to the procedure. &quot;We tried to make sure that everything was transparent, we gave him the benefit of the doubt hoping that he was really looking for good defence lawyers, (but) as soon as we saw he was playing games we stopped,&quot; Adede told reporters on Saturday. The tribunal provides defence counsel to suspects who say they cannot afford to hire their own lawyers. It will examine Akayesu's request later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Rwanda, a former Hutu politician accused of being one of the architects of the 1994 genocide, goes on trial in Kigali tomorrow. Froduald Karamira was a vice-president of a faction of the MDR party and allegedly a leader of the Interahamwe militia. He is charged with inciting genocide and committing crimes against humanity which carries a mandatory death penalty.  Every day, as the slaughter of Tutsis was underway, he allegedly made inflammatory broadcasts on extremist Hutu Radio Mille Collines (RTLM).  Reuters reported Deputy Justice Minister Gerard Gahima as saying his ministry would receive funds from the UN to provide legal representation for genocide suspects, under an agreement to be formalised this week. The trial of two suspects, sentenced to death last week, came under criticism after it was learned that the accused had no defence counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The US ambassador in Kinshasa, Daniel Simpson, accused Rwanda and Uganda of aggression against Zaire, during an interview broadcast by state television. &quot;We understand perfectly that Zaire has been attacked by Rwanda and Uganda,&quot; he said. &quot;This poses problems both on the political and the humanitarian front.&quot; He added that the USA was &quot;totally against&quot; division or secession in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran condemned the &quot;savage aggression&quot; against Zaire and offered its good offices for a peaceful resolution to the rebellion in eastern Zaire, Zairean radio reported last week. It quoted Iran's charge d'affaires in Kinshasa as saying the Zaire situation was &quot;tragic&quot;. &quot;Iran accepted...to mediate in the conflict between Zaire and its eastern neighbours,&quot; the radio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Six senior Zairean army officers are to appear before military tribunals on various charges of desertion, rape and pillage in eastern Zaire.  Government spokesman Koloni Longo, who made the announcement on state television last week, said &quot;uncontrolled elements of the Zairean army have committed acts of vandalism and carried out exactions on the population&quot;. He added that the province of Upper Zaire, which has seen some of the worst looting by mutinous troops, had been declared a disaster zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Mobutu, who returned to France from Zaire on Thursday, underwent minor surgery on Friday at a Monaco hospital, Associated Press reported. He was admitted to the urology department and was expected to remain in hospital for several days. No further details were given. Mobutu underwent surgery for prostate cancer in August, finally returning to Zaire last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rebels in northern Uganda have killed more than 200 people in the Kitgum district in five days, the independent 'Monitor' newspaper reported today. It claimed some 400 members of the Lord's Resistance Army entered Uganda from Sudan on January 5 and went on the rampage, indiscriminately killing local people. However, Minister of State for Defence, Amama Mbabazi, quoted by the state-owned 'New Vision' newspaper, denied any knowledge of mass killings by LRA rebels, saying the only report he had received from the area was the killing of six rebels by government troops during fighting over the weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopian has described as a &quot;baseless fabrication&quot; Sudanese claims that its troops shelled two border towns Sunday before they were captured by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) of Col.  John Garang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa's denial of involvement was aired Monday on Ethiopian Television. The station quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that the Sudanese accusation was &quot;simply a tactic to redress and externalize the country's internal problems.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in Khartoum have ordered a general mobilization to defend Sudan, after conceding that the two border towns in Blue Nile Province had fallen to the anti-government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Gen. Omar el Bashir alleged that the SPLA rebels were backed by Ethiopian troops which had shelled the two towns, enabling their seizure by the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan's parliament has accused Ethiopia of violating all international norms, charters and principles of good neighborliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament said Monday that the attack was &quot;only a part of the plot&quot; led by countries spearheaded by the United States of America and &quot;Zionist forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This plot, it added, started a long ago and involved an economic embargo, media campaigns aimed at tarnishing Sudan's image, and anti-Khartoum resolutions and sanctions passed and imposed by international organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan is under a limited embargo imposed by the United Nations for its failure to handover, for trial in neighboring Ethiopia, Egyptians who allegedly participated in a bid to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa on 26 June, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese parliament called on all Arab and Moslem states to condemned plots against Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang claimed Monday that the Unified Opposition Forces of North and Southern Sudan, now under his command, had captured the entire Nile Province, which borders Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most prominent Sudanese opposition leader and former prime minister, Sadiq al Mahdi, recently fled into exile in neighboring Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his arrival in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, Mahdi announced that he was joining other externally-based opposition groups seeking to topple Bashir, who overthrew Mahdi's democratically elected government in June 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese officials had minimized the impact of Mahdi's escape, saying this had only helped to cut him off from his supporters in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana attracted some 300,000 tourists in 1996, yielding an impressive total cash receipt of 248 million U.S dollars, the Ministry of Tourism said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most arrivals were from Ghana's traditional tourism generating markets -- the United States, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana also became a destination for a significant number of tourists from Canada, Switzerland and other European and African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, Ghana received 286,000 visitors and cash receipts of 237 million dollars, the Director of Research and Information at the ministry, Abraham Bekoe, told the Ghana News Agency on Tuesday in Accra.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the sector expected an average tourist inflow of 399,000 annually from now till the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign exchange receipts for tourist arrivals over the next three years, he said, would be an average of 386 million dollars each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry officials say the heaviest influx of tourists into the country in 1997 is expected to occur in March, during the country's 40th independence anniversary celebration and later in August during the Pan-African Historical Theatre Festival, or PANAFEST '97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Bekoe said that apart from these two major attractions, the sector was poised to enjoy a significant increase in tourist traffic, especially from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed optimism at this &quot;because of the impact of the ministry's promotional initiative there, the improvement in direct air links and Ghana's growing image as a tourist destination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One major achievement of the industry in Ghana, he said, was that hotel beds had more than doubled during the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana has about 10,783 hotel beds which the tourism ministry expects to increase significantly by the middle of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At present, more than half of this total -- that is 5,556 -- of our beds are in budget class hotels. But most of the new ones expected this year are all of international standard ranging between two-star and five-star,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of these, he said, that Ghana expected an additional 2,750 beds all over the country by the year 2,010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the new hotels still under construction, such as Accra's Palm Beach Hotel at La, and the Golden Beach Resort at Elmina in the central region are expected to be ready for occupation by June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 168-bed Elmina Golden Beach Resort, owned by the Social Security and National Insurance Trust, is said to be of strategic importance to the August PANAFEST event, to be hosted exclusively in Cape Coast and Elmina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bekoe said the ministry expected 70 percent of all hotel projects and other receptive facilities within the festival zone to be completed before the start of the festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The estimated shortfall of thirty percent in hospitality facilities is expected to be taken care of by other installations outside the immediate activity areas such as Takoradi and hostel facilities at the University of Cape Coast,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bekoe said airline operations in Ghana which previously constituted a major limitation to the growth of tourism, had now picked up impressively, increasing from only nine airlines a few years ago to 15 today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good thing is that these increases are not just by mere local representation. They are increases reflected in terms of flight frequency,&quot; he said. &quot;Chances are, that very soon, some of these airlines will start operating daily schedules in Ghana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bekoe said the ministry had a 15-year National Tourism Development Programme that will run until 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first phase of the programme, a five-year Tourism Action Plan, was set in motion in late 1996. It embraces various small programmes designed to unearth as well as boost the country's tourism potentials on a regional basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These regional tourism programmes have been so fashioned to correspond with government's commitment to opening up the hinterlands, stimulating rural economies and eventually strengthening district authorities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important feature of the programme is a five-year marketing strategy and promotional programme. This initiative is intended to &quot;sell Ghana as a more rewarding and preferable destination on the highly competitive international tourism market.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The executive-secretary of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Bingu wa Mutharika, accused on Tuesday unnamed &quot; external forces&quot; of working to kill the organization by influencing some member states to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are people out there who are not happy that Africans with black skins can sit down and get success. Unfortunately, we are victim of our own success,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika, a Malawian, was speaking at a news conference in Lusaka, the Zambian capital. He was reacting to announcements by Lesotho and Mozambique that they were withdrawing from the 20-nation common market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the decision by the two countries as a matter of concern to the heads of state and government of the common market, and to himself. He appealed to both nations to re-consider their decision in the name of Pan- Africanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika noted that, unlike the much smaller Southern Africa Development Community, the common market -- also know by its acronym, Comesa -- was not an aid-coordinating agency. Rather, he said, it was a common market with the an objective of promoting regional integration by developing a larger market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comesa is an organization established by Africans, executed by Africans, for Africans,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope that both Mozambique and Lesotho will carefully take full account of medium and long-term development interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed fear that the common market would experience the same fate as the East African Community that grouped Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. This community, which created in 1967, was officially disbanded in 1983 because of political differences among heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mozambique and Lesotho will go around the circle like the East African nations went through and, later, after realizing their mistakes, will come back to cause problems,&quot; Mutharika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed rumors that Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were also planning to withdraw from Comesa to concentrate on the newly-created East African Cooperation Arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he said he was unaware that Namibia was also likely to withdraw. The said that Namibia's withdrawal request had not been officially communicated to Comesa's headquarters in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comesa's Council of Ministers will be meeting later this week in Lusaka.  The council will discuss concrete measures to strengthen the body following the withdrawal of Lesotho and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other 18 Comesa member countries are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comesa was created under a treaty signed in Kampala, Uganda, in late 1994.  It succeeded the Eastern and Southern African Preferential Trade Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana and South africa are the only other Southern African states which have never joined Comesa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe Express Airlines (ZEX), a private operator, has acquired a third aircraft to service its Bulawayo to Harare route which was launched Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 100 Bulawayo and Harare business executives flew on the inaugural flights on the Boeing 727-100 tri-jet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline's public relations manager, Peter Mukuna, said the carrier was leasing the 118-seat American-built jet from Million Air Charter. A second Boeing 727 is to be leased from the South African-based charter company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zex's second aircraft, a 44-seater Hawker, is also being leased from a South African-based company, Executive Aerospace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukuna said the new business express service between Harare and Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's two leading cities, would be mainly to serve the business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ZEX would offer a free flight between the two cities whenever a plane was delayed for more than one hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are giving the most efficient service at an economy fare but most importantly we are saying time is money and the business concept is punctuality for an appointment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZEX's normal two return flights between Bulawayo and Harare begin Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Zaire - most information as of 10 January</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Health situation in Tingi Tingi and Amisi (location of estimated 160,000 refugees) deteriorating. Concern growing on condition of an estimated 25,000 refugees in Shabunda, cut off from humanitarian assistance since 24 December by insecurity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) Total refugee population as of 7 January is 270,607.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. ZAIRE - most information as of 10 January</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP staff working in the area have reported that the health and nutrition situation in Tingi Tingi and Amisi, where an estimated 160,000 refugees have gathered, has been deteriorating. In Shabunda, where an estimated 25,000 refugees have gathered, the actual condition of the refugees is uncertain. Information on the area has not been available since an increase in insecurity led to the departure of the last humanitarian organisation working in the area, on 24 December. No humanitarian assistance has been possible to Shabunda since that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 From 18 December to 7 January, WFP flew a total of 684 metric tons (mt) of mixed food commodities to Kisangani out of which 80 mt arrived directly from Kinshasa. 149 mt of UNIMIX (included in the total tonnage) were transported on behalf of UNICEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Most of the food that arrives in Kisangani is being on-forwarded by WFP to the refugees in Tingi Tingi and Amisi by both airlifting in smaller aircraft and over land. Due to the very poor condition of roads from Kisangani and insecurity along the Kisangani-Lubutu road, the journey by road takes a minumum of two days to reach Tingi Tingi and Amisi. Limited airstrips have allowed WFP to ferry in food by aircraft, however these smaller aircraft, capable of landing on the short runways, airlift a maximum of 6 metric tons at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 WFP's strategy is to use, and improve where possible, surface transport, both into Kisangani and onwards to the refugee locations, and in the meantime increase air transport capacity to cope with the immediate needs.  WFP has been building up its delivery capacity and is at present able to deliver an estimated 64 metric tons a day to the estimated 160,000 refugees in the Tingi Tingi and Amisi areas which represents approximately 75 per cent of their current food requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 WFP has thus far carried out two food distributions in Tingi Tingi, one food distribution in Amisi and two food distributions in Kisangani. A total of 303 mt has been distributed: 260 mt in Tingi Tingi and 24 mt in Amisi to refugees, and 19 mt to internally displaced persons in Kisangani. The distributions have been carried out through two partner NGOs, CEPZA and CARITAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 The WFP food stock in Kisangani as of 7 January amounted to a total of 350.6 mt, consisting of 70.2 mt CSB, 109.9 mt UNIMIX, 104 mt maize, 42.2 mt pulses, 19.4 mt high-energy biscuits, 3.9 mt oil, 0.95 mt salt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 The WFP Andover aircraft continues to make rotations between Kisangani and Amisi, supplemented by a DC-3 operating into Tingi Tingi. WFP is airlifting food commodities as well as needed supplies for other agencies.  The Andover aircraft has not yet been able to land in Tingi Tingi due to the condition of the landing strip. Work on the airstrip is continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.8 The security situation in Kisangani is calm for the time being. Some international NGOs, including MSF-France and ICRC, are returning to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.9 Goma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The security situation is reported to be deteriorating in the Goma area.  Fighting has been reported between 20 and 45 km to the north. Five people have been reportedly killed and several injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) An estimated 2,350 persons returned to Rwanda from Goma from 30 December to 5 January. WFP continues to distribute high-energy biscuits to all returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) WFP continues to supplement hospitals and health centres with biscuits to feed the malnourished and the hospitalised. Monitoring of these centres is carried out on a daily basis and in conjunction with the agencies involved in the health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) WFP field staff visited three camps of Zairean internally displaced persons in the area west of Goma and reported an estimated 5,350 persons located there. Several cases of malnutrition particularly among children, have been noticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.10 Bukavu: Rwandan refugees continue to come out of the forest near Bukavu and cross the Rwanda/Zaire border at Cyangugu. From 1 to 8 January, 4, 601 Rwandan refugees crossed the border. WFP provided 1.7 mt of high-energy biscuits along the road up to the border during this period. The security situation is reported calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 From 23 December to 5 January, tension remained high despite an announced cease-fire from 24 December to 3 January by CNDD. Rebel attacks and violence were reported across the country. The RN3 road remains closed to UN traffic. The southern part of Kayanza province remains troubled and of no access to UN Agencies and NGOs in the region. MSF-Holland has temporarily left Kayanza the province. Fighting has been reported in Muramvya province, where several people have been wounded by machetes. Muyinga city witnessed a tight military control of its population with identity papers being verified and houses searched during the reporting period. Burglary and theft of vehicles are on the increase with several attacks aimed at expatriates in Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Mine incidents continue to be reported in several parts of the country; these include unofficial reports of anti-personnel mines. An anti-tank mine was deactivated the morning of a WFP distribution in Mubimbi commune, on the road leading to the site, while several roads are reportedly mined in Kayanza province. This situation poses a serious threat to WFP staff travelling to the interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Local media reported that a cholera epidemic broke out in Rumonge commune of Bururi province, a region which remains highly unstable at the present time and of extremely difficult access for UN agencies and NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 The WFP Burundi caseload totalled 143,274 between 23 December and 5 January. This includes the following: emergency relief for 75, 410 people in the provinces of Gitega Kayanza, Bujumbura, Karuzi, Cankuzo and Bururi; general distribution for 3,481 beneficiaries including new arrivals (869) at the Gatumba transit; returnee and refugee packages for 39,961, including returnees waiting to be transferred to their home provinces and refugees from Zaire (Banyamulenge) in Bubanza province; small-scale short-term food-for- work projects for 13,490; and 10,932 vulnerable people in Selective Feeding Programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 WFP Burundi has been authorised by the Tanzanian National Sanctions Coordinating Committee to use barges from Kigoma to Bujumbura on Lake Tanganyika for food deliveries. WFP will organise the first convoy as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.6 WFP operations in Burundi are threatened by low fuel reserves.  Authorisation to import more fuel is still awaited from the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee. At 5 January, diesel stocks stood at 3,893 litres and petrol at 3,445 litres which represents one week supply only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 The repatriation from Tanzania has been largely completed. An estimated 480,000 refugees are reported to have come back in the last three weeks. WFP is providing food-aid to all returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 Repatriation from Zaire continues, with the numbers of returnees dropping. Last week, 1,440 returnees came via Cyangugu and 840 via Gisenyi.  31 returnees also arrived from Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Nutritional problems have not been reported regarding returnees from Tanzania, however a number of malnutrition cases have been reported among returnees currently coming from Zaire. Reports of malnutrition have also been received from some areas hosting high numbers of &quot;old caseload&quot; returnees (in Kibungo and Umutara prefectures).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 Emergency distributions of high-energy biscuits have been stopped in all parts of the country because almost all returnees have already reached their home communes. During the operation, WFP distributed some 350 mt of biscuits (1.4 million daily rations), mostly in Kibungo, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri prefectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.5 Since the beginning of the repatriation, in mid-November, WFP provided, and distributed in cooperation with NGO partners, some 16,256 mt of food country-wide. This represents 972,752 people assisted with a monthly ration.  Most distributions are carried out at the commune level, to heads of households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.6 All returnees from Zaire have received their first month food aid entitlement and the second month distributions are currently underway.  Returnees from Tanzania are still receiving their first month ration (over 70 percent have already been assisted). First month ration consists of 417 g of maize, 120 g beans and 20 g oil per person, per day (2,038 kcal) and the second month of 250 g of maize, 50 g CSB, 120 g beans, 20 g oil (1,550 kcal).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.7 The number of refugees coming to and residing in Rwanda has been dropping. Only 18 asylum seekers came from Burundi and five from Zaire last week. Following the repatriation of over 5,000 Zaireans from Mudende camp (Gisenyi), only 32 refugees remain and their departure is expected in the near future. The number of Burundian refugees in Kigeme camp (Gikongoro) decreased to 1,532 people following repatriation of some 800 persons.  Currently, there are around 15,000 Zairean refugees and 5,000 Burundian refugees in refugee camps in Kibuye, Cyangugu and Gikongoro prefectures. WFP continues to provide food to all refugees in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.8 The general security situation in Rwanda remained relatively stable from 1 to 6 January however a number of incidents were recorded: nine civilians were killed in Gitarama; at least four armed attacks occurred on local authority representatives in Gisenyi; and an RPA patrol was attacked in Ruhengeri. National security forces attributed all these attacks to the ex- FAR and Interahamwe elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.9 UN HRFOR has reported that an estimated 2,600 of the returnees who came from Tanzania were arrested on allegations of taking part in the 1994 genocide. Some 700 more were arrested during November, among those coming from Zaire. Some returnees reportedly turned themselves in to the police, fearing reprisals from the local population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.10 Trials for genocide suspects started in several towns in Rwanda (Kibungo, Kigali, Byumba). Thus far, two defendants have been found guilty and sentenced to death in Kibungo. Currently, there are around 90,000 detainees awaiting trial. The Rwanda Government recently made public a list of 1,900 suspects who could face death sentence, considering the extent of their involvement in the genocide. The trials continue nation-wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 The Government of Tanzania and UNHCR have declared that all Burundian refugees in Ngara will be moved to Lumasi camp, and that other camps in Ngara hosting Burundians (Kitali and Lukole) will be closed shortly. The Kitali camp caseload is to be moved to Lumasi by 12 January. Meanwhile, hostilities which broke out between Burundian refugees in Kitali camp, led to the death of nine refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 The Tanzanian police is combing villages in Kagera region in search of Rwandan refugees. Those found are moved to Rusumo border point for repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 The Tanzanians displaced in the Keza area due to conflicts with the refugees will return to their villages shortly. WFP will provide a two-week take-home ration for them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 17 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, January 10, 1997. Note: The last situation report was dated January 2, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted the Banyarwanda in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control. In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee. The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, and south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of shelling from Rwanda on October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps near Goma, fled to Mugunga camp. Both the ex-FAR and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)-financed Zairian Camp Security Contingent (CZSC) became involved in the fighting. After suffering defeat, the FAZ and CZSC retreated west and north, looting villages and displacing Zairians from Goma town and surrounding areas. After Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the ADFL counter-attacked from the east on November 14, forcing the ex- FAR and Interahamwe to retreat west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee. The ADFL has steadily continued its advance, seizing the gold-mining town of Bunia on December 24. The FAZ meanwhile have announced preparations for a counter-attack to reclaim lost territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government (USG) Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date) - $93,529,153</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan refugees: An estimated 555,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from the Eastern Zaire camps to Rwanda between November and the end of December. A total of 719,307 returned during 1996, the UNHCR reports. Of the 535,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, almost all have repatriated to Rwanda: about 6, 500 returned between September 10 and December 12, and 473,082 returned from December 14-31. A total of 483,445 returned during 1996. The UNHCR claims there are more than 330,000 Rwandans stranded in Eastern Zaire, with 120,000 in Tingi-Tingi, just to the south of Lubutu, in North Kivu, and 150,000 in Shabunda, in South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, some 62,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania. The balance are unaccounted for. Newly Displaced: Fleeing continued fighting in Burundi, a new caseload of about 100,000 Burundian refugees has entered Tanzania. Approximately 35,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania. Some 800 Rwandan and Zairian Tutsis remain in the Congo and 11,500 Zairians are reported in Uganda. The U.S. Embassy in Zaire estimates that 170,000 Zairians have been displaced by the conflict in eastern Zaire, including 20,000 from Uvira, 60,000 from Bukavu, 40,000 from Goma, and 50,000 from rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR reported that as of December 31, 473,082 Rwandan refugees had returned from Tanzania since December 14, and that the mass return from Tanzania has ended. The UNHCR admits that its longstanding estimate of 540, 000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania could have been an overestimate. It has declared that 52,300 Rwandans have fled into the Tanzanian countryside and south of Kigoma, where some could be posing as Burundian refugees. In Zaire, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) reported on December 30 that relief agencies had temporarily withdrawn expatriate staff from Shabunda and Lubutu because of security concerns. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) estimated there were 60,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees and 3,000 displaced Zairians in Shabunda at the time it evacuated its workers from there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICRC and Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) operations in Lubutu continue under the supervision of local staff. In the Lubutu area, 300 km northwest of Goma, MSF identified about 70,000 refugees and several thousand displaced Zairians in the area who need assistance. UNICEF and Action of Churches Together (ACT) are airlifting supplies from Nairobi to Kisangani, for overland transport to Lubutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 18, President Mobutu Sese Seko returned to Zaire from France, where he was convalescing from cancer. He announced that he would take measures to recover the territory lost to the rebels. That day Zairian television announced the appointment of General Mahele Bokoungo Lieko as the new army chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 24, Bunia fell to the ADFL, and on January 2, the Alliance claimed to have captured Mangbwalu, 25 miles north of Bunia, and the Kilo- moto gold mining region, covering 83,000 square km. The ADFL also is believed to control the nearby towns of Boga, Geti, and Mambasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. sources in Kinshasa report that the Zairian Special Presidential Division troops control Kisangani, which is under curfew. Uvira, Bukavu, and Goma remain under ADFL control. The GOZ last week repeated its refusal to negotiate with Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1080, approved November 15, a Canadian-led multinational force (MNF) was formed to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the repatriation of refugees. On December 23 the UN Security Council accepted Canada's recommendation to end the MNF, effective December 31. The USG will continue to use diplomatic means to help humanitarian organizations gain full access in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Canada hosted a multi-donor meeting in Kigali on December 13 on the reintegration of Rwandan refugees. Representatives from 12 countries, the European Union, U.N. agencies, and the Government of Rwanda (GOR) met to discuss developments since the refugees began returning on November 15, to present GOR priorities, to review donor programs, and to discuss donor coordination efforts. The GOR reiterated its priorities of housing, security, justice and human resource development and called on donors to support whole communities, including returnees and existing residents alike. Shelter remains the highest priority, with the GOR reporting that populations have doubled or tripled in certain communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire: Humanitarian agencies established a Coordination Committee in Kisangani to coordinate relief assistance in the area, including Lubutu. WFP airlifted 120 MT of food to Kisangani in late December. From there it has worked with La Procure, the logistics service branch of the Catholic Church, to take the food on to Lubutu and Tingi-Tingi.  The ICRC delivered 10 metric tons (MT) of relief supplies to Kisangani for refugees and displaced persons and on December 17, it began distributing food rations to 4,400 Zairian displaced persons and 800 refugees in Kalemie. UNICEF is airlifting 10 MT of relief supplies daily to the Kisangani area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports it has assisted in the repatriation of 35,000 refugees who have emerged from hiding in the Virunga National Park near Goma since November 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 9, the UNHCR announced the suspension of its activities north of Goma, due to insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: Returnees from Tanzania are reportedly in good condition, as there was low malnutrition in the camps, most refugees have been vaccinated and they are carrying shelter materials with them. Registration is underway in the communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UNHCR figures released on December 12, local authorities in the communes registered over 470,000 Rwandans returning from eastern Zaire during the month of November.  Food distribution is underway in all prefectures of Rwanda. WFP distributed 12,295 MT of food from December 16 to December 24, and had 7,107 MT of food available for immediate distribution as of December 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From November 15 to December 12, WFP and NGO partners distributed about 9, 700 MT of food commodities, representing over 580,000 people assisted with monthly rations. In addition, over one million high-protein biscuits were distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 31, the GOR announced that all food was to be distributed through local authorities, and not NGOs, as previously practiced. The WFP was requested to transport food to the communes, from which the UNHCR would take it to points for distribution by local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the repatriation from Tanzania, the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) reports that in Kibungo Prefecture, 2,243 returnees are in detention, and 676 are detained in Mutara Prefecture. Most of the returnees from Tanzania originally came from the two prefectures.  Nationally, Rwandan authorities have detained 5,460 returnees between November 15 and December 31. GOR authorities have also registered 1,931 members of the ex-FAR in Gisenyi prefecture. Authorities are still compiling registrations in other prefectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for permanent shelter poses a major concern for the GOR. The GOR estimates that 200-250,000 will need new homes. An authoritative tally of new housing has not been undertaken, and shelter needs country-wide are not yet coordinated. WFP and UNHCR both report to have built about 6,000 new houses in 1996. The UNHCR also distributed 13,182 shelter kits as of November 30, 1996. Officially, the GOR has given squatters two weeks to vacate dwellings belonging to returnees but implementation of this policy appears varied at the commune level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trials of Rwandans suspected of involvement in the 1994 genocide began on December 27 in Kibungo. Two suspects were sentenced to death on January 3.  Their lawyers have appealed the verdict. On December 30 in Kigali, the trial of two other genocide suspects was adjourned and moved to Gitarama. With the permission of the GOR, a French and two Belgian lawyers from Lawyers Without Borders are scheduled to arrive in Kigali on January 11 to assist Rwandan genocide suspects in their defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 31, the bourgmestre of Rukira commune, Kibungo prefecture, and his assistant were killed in a collision with a UNHCR water truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: Burundian Army officials claimed on Tanzanian radio that Hutu rebels launched an attack in southern Burundi on December 24, killing four Burundian Army soldiers, an undisclosed number of civilians, and losing thirteen of their own. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, reported on December 11 that more than 1,000 people were massacred in Burundi between late October and late November. WFP reports that Kayanza and Bujumbura Rural provinces are insecure and the situation has deteriorated in Bubanza province. Many parts of Bururi, Muramvya, Gitega, and Karuzi provinces remain unsafe. MSF Holland (MSF/H) announced on January 6 that it was suspending its operations in Kayanza province because of insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that of the 62,000 Burundian refugees who have returned to Burundi from Zaire, about 45,000 spontaneously repatriated to Cibitoke province and 15,000 arrived through the Gatumba transit center outside Bujumbura. WFP is distributing returnee packages to both populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Burundi, UNHCR, and NGOs are monitoring returns to insecure areas. UNHCR reports that about 38,000 of the returnees to Cibitoke have settled in 10 government sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda: The Ugandan Government has agreed to the UNHCR's request to grant temporary refugee status to 3,081 Rwandan refugees who fled from the Karagwe area of Tanzania to Orutshinga camp, 260 km west of Kampala. On December 18, a local government official said the refugees who had registered in Orutshinga after leaving Karagwe would either have to go home or back to Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR reported 9,273 Rwandan refugees in Kisoro and 4,006 at Kihihi camp, in Matanda district, near Zaire. All arrived since in Uganda since the mass repatriation. In Nebbi, northwestern Uganda, 200 Zairian refugees arrived, having fled the advance of Alliance rebels in Eastern Zaire.  Tanzania: UNHCR officials have expressed concern at reports of brutality by members of the Tanzanian security forces involved in the repatriation of Rwandan refugees. In late December, the GOT announced the arrest of a Tanzanian police officer suspected of involvement in the death of a Rwandan refugee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tanzanian newspaper quoted the general in command of the refugee repatriation as saying that Tanzanian Defense Forces would begin house-to- house searches on January 1 in Ngara and Karagwe for escaped Rwandan refugees.  Tanzanian forces reportedly detained 50 refugees from camps near Ngara and 100 from Karagwe. UNHCR reported that 49 refugees, 35 of whom confessed to being killers, turned themselves over to the agency in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date about 20 Rwandan refugees chose to commit suicide rather than return, USAID officials reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 52,300 refugees remain in Tanzania, the UNHCR reports. In the Ngara camps, 83,305 Burundians remain; in Kibondo district, there are 91,880 refugees, all Burundian but for 2,168 people of mixed marriages; in Kasulu, there are 77,106 Burundians and Zairians; in Kigoma town there are about 5, 000 people. UNHCR reported that 34,000 new refugees arrived in Tanzania from Zaire and Burundi in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 30,000 Rwandan refugees from the Karagwe camps remain at large. The UNHCR reported that Tanzanian security forces identified about 100 Rwandan intimidators and have moved them to facilities in Mwiza, northern Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, report on the situation, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N. agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist with repatriation efforts. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Robert Gribbin, declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire posed a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire, as a result of the violent break-up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire.  On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region. On November 25, Ambassador Morris Hughes declared a disaster in Burundi, as a result of continuing civil strife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - 6-7.01.97 -- A seminar about transitions to democracy in the world took place in Rabat, organised by the Abderrahim Bouabid Foundation and presided by Prince Sidi Mohamed, heir of the Moroccan kingdom. In his opening speach the Prince declared the advance of democracy in his country is conditionned to the respect of &quot;the holy values of our people&quot;, which means monarchy and the integrity of the Moroccan territory including Western Sahara.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Waterbury, author of the critical analysis of Morocco &quot;Commander of the Faithfull&quot; published in 1970 and still forbidden in Morocco, participated at this event. In an interview with the news agency EFE, the US specialist of political science said Morocco has changed, passing from a &quot;culture of repression&quot; to a &quot;culture of administration&quot;. &quot;Before, violence was used to govern. A violence which had to be shown. Now, administration is used to govern, violence is no more necessary. The monarchy is not questioned&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - GREAT LAKES GENERAL * Not surprisingly, Rwandan returns have been accompanied by an intensive focus on reintegration efforts in Rwanda. The ongoing conflicts in Burundi and eastern Zaire with spill-over into Uganda and Tanzania present continuing humanitarian challenges. As we adjust regional strategies to new circumstances, department would find it useful to hear from UNHCR's senior leadership on its proposed plan of action for the coming months in the great lakes. (STATE 5018, 1/9/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan has recommended the appointment of a special representative for the Great Lakes region. ... Annan said that though the original idea was to send an envoy who would do another &quot; exploratory round&quot; in the region, he preferred the appointment of a special representative, who will be based in the area. (PAN AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY, 1/9/97, courtesy of Relief Web)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR assistant High Commissioner Vieira de Mello responded favorably to our request for a visit to Washington in the next two weeks. He welcomed the opportunity to discuss with the department coordination issues, regional strategies and UNHCR's plans for 1997. (GENEVA 108, 1/10/97)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REPATRIATION TO RWANDA * On December 28, 13,414 refugees returned to Rwanda from Tanzania. UNHCR has declared that the mass refugee return from Tanzania is now finished. (KIGALI 49, USAID/DART Field Sitrep, 1/6/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Around 473,082 returnees arrived in southeastern Rwanda from Tanzania between 14 and 31 December, while 555,000 have come back from Zaire since November. (UNHCR, 1/7/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR repatriation figures for 1996 showed that a total of 1,300,582 refugees returned home last year. Of these, 719,307 returned from Zaire, 483, 445 from Tanzania, 88,309 from Burundi, and 9,521 from Uganda. (IRIN Emergency Update *73, 1/7/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Small numbers of Rwandan stragglers continue to cross the border from Tanzania daily. Tanzanian forces are continuing to search for those in hiding, at least until next week when funding for the military operation runs out.  (DAR ES SALAAM 232, 1/10)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Repatriation from Zaire continues, but at slower pace, with 1,440 returnees returning via Cyangugu and 840 via Gisenyi last week. ... Rwandan refugees continue to come out of the forest near Bukavu and cross the Rwanda/Zaire border at Cyangugu. From 1 to 8 January, 4,601 Rwandan refugees crossed the border. (WFP EMERGENCY REPORT *2, 1/10/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SITUATION IN RWANDA: * Hutu hardliners, some infiltrating Rwanda among a million returning refugees, have carried out massacres inside the country as well as crossborder raids, Rwandan government and aid sources said Tuesday.  Up to 50 people, including Rwandan soldiers, civilians and armed infiltrators from Zaire, have been killed since Christmas, a Rwandan defense spokesman and aid sources said. (Reuters, 1/7/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Eight assailants dies and one was captured after &quot;infiltrators&quot; exchanged fire with Rwandan soldiers in Ruhengeri prefecture over the weekend, Rwandan radio reported. (IRIN Emergency Update No. 73, 1/7/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The problem-plagued tribunal on Rwanda's 1994 genocide adjourned after a brief start on Thursday when the prosecution failed to present witnesses because they had not arrived from Rwanda, the court heard. (Reuters, 1/9/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* As for the treatment of returnees, the HRFOR continues to receive reports of ill-treatment in communal detention centres and during interrogations, as well as of illegal arrest procedures. HRFOR is particularly concerned with the level of tension between the local population and recently-arrived returnees in Kibungo. (UNHCR, 1/7/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Some 5,460 recent Rwandan returnees were being held in detention throughout Rwanda as of 31 December 1996, according to a 6 January report from the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. (UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1/7/97, courtesy of ReliefWeb)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shelter * Estimates of the number of new shelters needed throughout Rwanda range from 200,000-250,000; yet the GOR, donors, and NGOs seem to lack a consistent strategy for meeting this need. While the GOR prefers to concentrate resources in resettlement sites as opposed to scattered settlement, many of the resettlement sites already constructed are unoccupied because they: 1) are located in areas where people do not want to live; 2) lack appropriate infrastructure; or 3) are designed in ways that are culturally unacceptable to returnees. (KIGALI 67, USAID/DART Field Sitrep, 1/7/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food * Food distribution at the commune level is becoming problematic, because the government of Rwanda recently changed the original agreement under which the WFP and NGOs were operating. ... On December 29, the prefet of Kibungo notified WFP in writing that NGOs are no longer to be used in food distributions and food is to be distributed at the sectoral level rather than at the communes. (KIGALI 49, USAID/DART Field Sitrep, 1/6/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Country-wide food distributions are going well generally speaking, and food is reaching those who need it. ... But the system put in place has led to unnecessary complications and confusion, particularly in the prefecture of Kibungo where the largest numbers of returnees were received and where the largest population of old caseload has resettled. The recent GOR decision to eliminate NGO participation in WFP distributions is a response to this confusion. (Currently 22 NGOs participate in the distributions.) The decision is also an effort by GOR to build the civil structures of the communes by strengthening local leadership and strengthening the confidence of newly returned citizens in local leadership. (KIGALI 48, 1/6/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The agricultural season in Rwanda's northern prefectures has been relatively good. Production totals in the north should be above average and the region should have an overall food surplus in staple commodities. ...  Famine early warning system (FEWS)/Rwanda estimates that Gitarama, Butare, and Gikongoro prefectures will face serious food shortages until the next harvest in June 1997. (KIGALI 146, USAID/DART Field Sitrep, 1/9/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* WFP/Rwanda Director hosted a meeting with the NGOs on January 6. ... WFP requested a readout from the NGOs on the communique of December 31 issued by Dr. Ephraim Kabajai, advisor to president of the republic of Rwanda and chairman of the joint commission for repatriation and reintegration of Rwandese refugees, and the emergency assistance coordination committee. ...  NGOs felt that most Bourgemasters and sector counsellors were happy to have NGOs implementing food distributions. ... NGOs believe that local authorities have limited managerial capacity and limited time, and would have problems running the distributions. ... All NGOs thought the percentage of loss was likely to be higher with distributions through local authorities. ... NGOs and WFP agree that distribution operations continue in the current mode until WFP clarifies key points within the communique with the GOR. (KIGALI 166, 1/10/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SITUATION IN ZAIRE: * A former chief of security at the French presidency has denied that he is putting together a mercenary force to help the government of Zaire fight... (Reuters, 1/8/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN refugee agency said Thursday it had suspended its activities north of Goma because of an ambush that left one person dead and six wounded. Craig Sanders of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the measure was in effect since Wednesday, the day of the attack, for security reasons and that no date had been set for resuming activities. (Paris AFP, 1/9/97, courtesy of FBIS)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* WFP continues to fly in food and relief materials to Kisangani by a Zairean chartered 707, from where it is moved either by road or by a locally chartered aircraft to Lubutu/Tingi-Tingi. Since the inception of the flights on 18 December to 1 January, WFP flights have moved in a total of 332 metric tons. WFP has begun another air operation, consisting initially of twenty flights with an Andover aircraft..., between Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi, Amisi or Shabunda. The destination will vary depending on the needs and security situation in each area. (WFP Emergency Report 1, 1/3/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The U.N. refugee agency expressed concern on Tuesday about more than 330, 000 Rwandan refugees still stranded in eastern Zaire, especially 120,000 in a camp short of food and thought to be dominated by thugs. Eleven to 15 people were dying every day at the Tingi Tingi camp, where food shortages had prompted conflict between the refugees and local Zaireans, spokeswoman Pamela O'Toole said. (Reuters, 1/7/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Desperately undernourished children are dying daily in makeshift refugee camps in eastern Zaire, the United Nations children's agency said Wednesday.  The death toll is growing at a remote camp in Tingi Tingi near Lubutu, where 23 deaths were reported on Monday, UNICEF said. (Associated Press, 1/8/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* No one has yet done a count of the &quot;refugees&quot; at Tingi-Tingi, or interviewed them to determine their status and under what international mandate they may be entitled to assistance. ... The two stories, &quot;refugees&quot; and the value of the Zaire currency, shared the African news spotlight January 8. News stories pointed out that Zaire's currency value was backed by nothing, but failed to make the same disclaimer about the UN agencies' refugee numbers. (KIGALI 129, 1/9/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Around Lubutu and Shabunda, where large numbers of Rwandan refugees and displaced Zairians have gathered, and throughout much of eastern Zaire military and militia activity proliferates, jeopardizing the security of international aid workers as well as refugees. Already ICRC and MSF were forced to withdraw from Shabunda after members of their respective staffs were threatened. On January 8, UNHCR suspended operations around Goma, Zaire after several cars were attacked, resulting in the death of one person and the wounding of six others. (Refugees International, 1/9/97, courtesy of ReliefWeb)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNICEF expressed deep concern, 8 January, at the deteriorating condition of the Rwandan refugees and internally displaced people sheltering in the Lubutu area, 170 kms southeast of Kisangani, in eastern Zaire. Recent reports reveal an alarming increase in the number of deaths among these people.  (UNICEF, 1/8/97, courtesy of Relief Web)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Despite its decision to withdraw from the area for the time being, the ICRC remains extremely concerned about the fate of the populations at Shabunda, who are stranded in the forest without any protection or assistance whatsoever. The ICRC will therefore be returning to Kindu as soon as possible to hold talks with the authorities and discuss its resumption of activities in the area once the security situation has stabilized. In addition, ways should be found for refugees in Shabunda to move to a location which poses fewer logistical obstacles to the provision of assistance, and from which refugees could return to Rwanda if they wished to do so. (ICRC, 1/8/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA: * The Tanzanian authorities over the weekend arrested 75 more Burundian and Zairean refugees who left their camps in the Kigoma region. A total of 16 Tanzanians who were allegedly harboring refugees in Kigoma town have also been arrested, Kigoma police commander Christopher Shekiondo said.  (IRIN Emergency Update *72, 1/6/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* With the vast majority of the Rwandan refugees having returned to Rwanda from Tanzania by 30 December, Tanzania currently accommodates approximately 248,000 registered refugees. The breakdown is as follows: 80,000 Burundian refugees in the Ngara region; 130,000 Burundian refugees in the kigoma region; 38,000 Zairean refugees in the kigoma region. The influx of Zairean and Burundian refugees into the Kigoma region continues with some 1,000 arriving per day. (WFP Emergency Report 1, 1/3/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The former Rwandan camps in Ngara and Karagwe districts have not as yet been leveled. UNHCR and NGOs are continuing to sweep the sites, collecting belongings and preparing for the razing of the camps. (DAR ES SALAAM 232, 1/10)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - UNHCR in Burundi has confirmed the massacre by the army of some 120 refugees who had returned from Tanzania, AFP reported. UNHCR chief in Bujumbura Hitoshi Mise said 122 returnees had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a special and particular case because (the refugees) were expelled by the Tanzanian authorities because of their involvement in violent clashes in which eight people were killed at the (Kitali) refugee camp,&quot; AFP quoted Mise as saying. In-fighting reportedly broke out earlier at the Kitali camp between Burundian Hutu extremists from the Palipehutu party and the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD). Burundian soldiers were said to have opened fire on Friday after panic broke out when 126 refugees were handed over by the Tanzanian authorities to the Kobero military post, near the northeast Burundian town of Muyinga, and then tried to escape. Mise said one of his colleagues who was on the spot described how a woman among the refugees had thrown a grenade towards the Burundian soldiers, although its pin was not pulled out. The matter, he added, was &quot;very complex&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania however today denied it had expelled the refugees. Deputy Minister for Home Affairs Emmanuel Mwambulukutu said as far as he knew Tanzania had never expelled Burundian refugees from its territory. &quot;We don't have a policy of expelling refugees,&quot; he said, according to AFP. &quot;The only refugees we have returned home are those who came from Rwanda. This we did after being assured of the restoration of peace and stability in that country.&quot; The number of Burundians entering Tanzania continued to rise, he said, and Tanzania had established two new camps to accommodate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Secretary General Kofi Annan yesterday expressed shock over the killings in Burundi and called for an end to the &quot;cycle of violence&quot; in the country.  He urged the authorities &quot;to ensure that the rule of law is scrupulously followed and to prevent further massacres by the army&quot;. There was a &quot;pressing need&quot; for an immediate ceasefire between the army and Hutu rebels, and for peace talks, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security remains a serious problem in northwest Rwanda. Employees of the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) were attacked in Gisenyi yesterday afternoon by an unidentified individual using hand grenades. As a result, UN security officials have suspended all travel by UN personnel to the prefecture as well as stopping UN human rights activities in Gisenyi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In further security incidents, three people were killed and three more wounded when about 60 armed men attacked a hospital in the northwest Rwandan town of Kabaya over the weekend, aid workers said yesterday. According to local people, the assailants were Hutus who had infiltrated from Zaire or from nearby forests and looted the hospital's pharmacy. Two MSF surgeons who were at the hospital were threatened, AFP said. Unconfirmed reports stated that the attackers also tried to storm the local jail where a number of genocide suspects are imprisoned. Rwandan radio yesterday reported the deaths of three people who were murdered in Nyakabande sector of Kigali urban prefecture. Four suspects had been detained following the murders in which the victims were blindfolded and killed using blunt weapons. Violence in Cyangugu prefecture resulted in a security meeting over the weekend convened by the prefect Faustin Munyakabera at Nyakabuye. The meeting noted in particular that five &quot;infiltrators&quot; were killed nine days ago during clashes with the security forces in the area. Residents were warned against collaboration with infiltrators, one of whom was present at the meeting.  According to Rwandan radio, he said his group of 23 men entered Rwanda from Bukavu last October but only 10 of them had escaped death or captivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tension is particularly high in communes where genocide survivors are in the minority, such as Kigali Rural prefecture. UNHCR reports that in Kanzenze, the 10,713 registered returnees heavily outnumber the local population which has led to a reluctance by genocide survivors to denounce suspects for fear of reprisals. UN sources said local authorities believe virtually all the male returnees in Kanzenze took part to some extent in the genocide and most female returnees participated in looting properties. However, only 33 people have been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An alleged ringleader of the 1994 genocide, former politician Froduald Karamira, went on trial in Kigali today, but the hearing was immediately adjourned for two weeks to give the defence more time to prepare its case.  The hearing began as Amnesty International again questioned the fairness of the trials in Rwanda. &quot;In a climate of bitterness and suspicion, there is a risk that those accused of genocide will be considered guilty unless proven innocent,&quot; Amnesty said in a statement released today. It said the the trials &quot;should conform to international standards of fairness including ensuring that the defendants have access to the court file and adequate time to prepare for their defence, are assisted by legal counsel, including foreign lawyers, and are allowed to call witnesses in their defence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila claimed that the Bukavu-Shabunda-Kindu axis had recently been &quot;infiltrated&quot; by Zairean and former Rwandan (ex-FAR) soldiers, leading to &quot;low-level fighting&quot; with the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL). Rebel Radio of the People, which broadcasts from Bukavu, yesterday said the Zairean/ex-FAR troops were &quot;silenced and defeated&quot;. The radio also pointed out that the &quot; massive counter-offensive&quot; awaited in eastern Zaire had not yet taken place, adding that Kabila had predicted that in the &quot;post-Mobutu period&quot;, the ADFL would come to power &quot;either via negotiations or through direct military action&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least three people were killed by Interahamwe members who attacked a village in the Goma area under ADFL control last week, Reuters reported, quoting a rebel officer. &quot;The village was attacked yesterday and again this morning (Friday) which was when the people were killed,&quot; said the officer who commands the checkpoint at Mushaki village. He added that the Interahamwe were located in nearby hills. AFP today cited local residents as saying hundreds of rebels had been combing the dense Virunga forests near Goma in a bid to flush out Zairean troops and Interahamwe. UN and NGO agencies reported an unusually high number of young men at the Tingi-Tingi camp near Lubutu and UN sources said they could be ex-FAR and Interahamwe who were using force to control the population. The sources said that since ADFL troops took Walikale on 25 December, refugees have been flowing out of the forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern has been expressed by humanitarian aid workers in the Lubutu area that food aid distributions in Tingi-Tingi and Amisi camps are not always reaching the intended beneficiaries. As in the Kivu camps in 1994, the most expedient way to distribute food, given staffing constraints, the large refugee population and security concerns, is to utilise existing camp structures, which parallel the Rwandan administrative structure. Concern has been raised that the distribution of food through the refugee leaders has led to inequitable food distributions with vulnerable groups being hardest hit.  NGOs, aware of the problem, are trying to move away from prefect leaders to a distribution through commune and eventually cell leaders. According to UNHCR, food distribution monitoring has also been increased. WFP said it was increasing food movements to Tingi-Tingi and Amisi to 160 mt a week by road and 25 mt a day by air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by UNICEF and MSF last week indicated elevated child mortality rates in refugee camps near Lubutu. Estimates from the cemetery and MSF feeding centres indicate a death rate of 20 people per day, most of them children under five. A recent UNICEF mission clarified that while the death rate among vulnerable groups was extremely high, the general refugee population was in relatively good health. They have been able to supplement their food needs by gathering wild plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugee population in Shabunda has not received food aid since the withdrawal of ICRC expatriate workers on 26 December. The UNHCR team in Kisangani has conducted two recent missions to the area and a third is planned for today. Because of time constraints and weather conditions, only the Burundian refugees closest to the airport have been visited to date. An intial assessment indicated that despite the lack of food aid the population visited seemed in relatively good condition. Some refugees in Shabunda have been able to find work in local gold mines. However, humanitarian sources caution that not all of the refugee encampments have been contacted and health conditions in the remaining camps may vary significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Tanzanian cabinet minister was gunned down at his home outside Dar es Salaam over the weekend, police said yesterday. Nicas Mahinda, a member of parliament and former natural resources and tourism minister, was showered with bullets on Sunday by a gang of about 30 thugs who jumped over the fence of his compound. Twenty-five people have been arrested in connection with the incident.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Revised statement by Spokesman Nicholas Burns, January 10, on the situation in the Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is concerned about the situation in the Central African Republic, and strongly supports a speedy resolution to the conflict between government and rebel factions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call on all parties to respect the rule of law and the democratic process. The United States applauds the efforts of those Central Africans who are working to find a peaceful solution to their political differences and the important role being played by former Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure. We urge all parties to respect the cease-fire negotiated by African heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States notes that there have been numerous casualties during these weeks of conflict, most recently this past weekend in an unprovoked attack on cease-fire monitors which resulted in the death of two French soldiers and a number of Central Africans, including civilian bystanders. We express sympathy to the families of the dead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Following are statements by the White House and State Department issued January 13, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excerpt from daily White House Press Briefing by spokesman Mike Mccurry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, there were reports out of South Africa that the South African government is considering selling $640 million worth of arms to Syria, including tank firing systems. Apparently there are some concerns, however, in South Africa about the stance that the U.S. government might take on such a sale. Does the U.S. have a position on that?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: We have a strongly worded statement here that amounts to saying we think that's a very bad idea. We're aware of those reports. We have not independently confirmed that they may be trying to transfer tank firing missile systems to Syria, but we urge the government of South Africa not to go through with the sale and we have confidence that the government of South Africa understands the seriousness of this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comments at daily press briefing by State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: There were reports that the South African cabinet has approved, in principle, a large sale of electronic tank equipment to Syria. Do you think that this could have an influence on the Middle East peace process at all? What are your views on that? Are you against that? Would you try to persuade them not to do that, and could this have any influence as far as you are concerned on the negotiations on the ARMSCOR case that is still in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Thank you. The United States is aware of the reports that South Africa is considering selling various weapons systems to Syria. We are deeply concerned about these reports. It would be extremely serious if these sales actually occurred. The United States hopes that the South African Government will not consummate arms sales to a country that supports terrorism. I think you know that both the Foreign Operations and the Foreign Assistance Act, the law of the United States, prohibits certain forms of U.S. assistance to governments which supply lethal equipment to Syria or to any of the other countries listed by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We would certainly analyze any potential sales in the context of our own laws. We would have to analyze any such sales and try to understand if in fact any violations of U.S. law took place. So it's a matter of very serious concern. We are now in touch with the South African Government. We'll remain in touch with them to try to ascertain if in fact these sales will go forward to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have independent confirmation of what's going on? You eluded to reports. Are they press reports? Is that all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Right. Among them. We have a variety of reports available to us and, as I said, we're trying on a first order of business to ascertain the plans of the South African Government. If in fact the sales go through, that would be a very serious matter indeed, and we'd then have to reflect upon the association of any acts or the relevance to our own laws, and I think you know the consequences of that, which are quite severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: How much aid could it affect, potentially?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: South Africa is one of our largest aid recipients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have a number, though?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Since I don't know what the outlines of any potential sale or actual sale would be, I think I want to demur there and say I can't anticipate what the effect would be, but in principle, any country that does sell military arms to a state sponsor of terrorism does expose itself to United States' law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: When did you find out about this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't know when we found out about it. We have a lot of people in this government. When did the first person in the U.S. Government, either in our Embassy in Cape Town or Pretoria or in Bureau of Intelligence and Research find out about this, I don't know, but we've been aware of it for a little while, and we are in contact with the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Can you say anything about the nature of the contacts -- how high they've gone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: They've certainly gone to a fairly high level in the South African Government, as represented by our Embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Have you talked with Mbeki?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't know if Mr. Mbeki has been contacted personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is it something that the Secretary talked to them about when he was out in Africa several months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I'd have to check that. I don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Could you get back? I'd be interested in that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I'd be glad to take that question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, on this same subject?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Yes. Is Vice President Gore likely to raise this at the meeting of the Binational Commission?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: That's an important meeting. All important issues will be raised.  I don't want to commit the Vice President to raising any specific issue.  Suffice it to say, this is on the top of our agenda with South Africa now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: These items have been described as tanks' firing systems. Are they actually weapons, or are they just components? And, if they're just components, would they violate --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: That's a good a question. That's the kind of information that we need from the South African Government. I think, first, does the South African Government contemplate sales of military equipment to Syria. If that is so, what type of equipment. Are they components to the assembly of a larger product. Is it a product itself. Would any such potential sales then violate U.S. law -- the Foreign Assistance Act, for instance. Those are the kinds of questions that we've got to answer before we can decide on a course of action for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in general, we believe that terrorism is a global battle. All countries are victims of terrorism. All of us have to bind together and act together to prevent terrorism, and we certainly ought not to put into the hands of state sponsors of terrorism -- in this case the Syrian Government -- lethal weaponry, and that's the core of the American concern as we look at this question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: So you know what these tank electronic systems would violate? For example, the Counter-Terrorism Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: No, I don't know what systems specifically we're talking about.  That's the line of inquiry here, so therefore I cannot answer that question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - With 1,300,582 people (UNHCR figure) returning to Rwanda since mid- November, much of ACT International's attention is now focused on assisting returnees in their home Prefectures in Rwanda i.e. provision of temporary shelter or permanent housing, distribution of food and non-food items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While ACT is busy through partners inside Rwanda, ACT members continue working with the remaining Burundian refugees in Tanzania as well as reaching out with assistance to some of the hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees and Zairian displaced in parts of Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern Zaire - assisting refugees and displaced Major concentrations of refugees and displaced in government controlled parts of Eastern Zaire have been identified in three places: Shabunda (25.000), Lubutu/Tingi-Tingi and Amisi (together approximately 160.000). These figures are World Food Programme (WFP) estimates - note though that none of these figures are based on systematic counting but are estimates based on observations on the ground.  And while some aid workers express concern over the unusually high percentages of young men amongst the refugees remaining in Eastern Zaire others point to the deteriorating health condition of some of refugees. At Tingi-Tingi for instance 810 malnourished children are in special feeding programmes. Shabunda was left by the ICRC on December 24, 1996 and information about the situation there has been scarce ever since.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cooperation with the WFP ACT members (Norwegian Church Aid and local partners) are flying, trucking and distributing food and non-food items (mainly medicine) to displaced in Lubutu and Kisangani as well as refugees at Tingi-Tingi and Masisi. Despite very difficult conditions on the ground ACT members have distributed more than 150 tons of food and medicine in these parts of Eastern Zaire. On top of this ACT is distributing relief items on behalf of WFP in Kisangani and Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both Bukavu and Goma areas, controlled by the Alliance for Democracy in Congo-Zaire (ADF), ACT member Christian Aid are working with local churches (among them the Eglise du Christ au Zaire) and NGO's to (re-)establish emergency and rehabilitation projects for the Zairian population affected by the war and turmoil in the region since September/October of 1996. For instance thousands of families fled Bukavu and Goma during the conflict in and around these and other major towns in Eastern Zaire. Many still remain in overcrowded villages living with families and friends. ACT plans to assist the displaced with badly needed food and non-food items in order for them to regain enough strength and confidence to return to their homes. In the Bukavu area local and international ACT members are working together to reestablish basic medical services to about 100.000 citizens. Another 4.000 families will be supported with agricultural seeds and tools. ACT members in Eastern Zaire are coordinating their activities at both the local level and in Nairobi, Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda - large scale shelter, housing and reconstruction ACT members are working towards assisting returning refugees and their receiving communities across Rwanda. Covered by ACT International appeals of late 1996 local and international ACT members are putting a high emphasis on shelter and housing programmes as this is seen as a priority area by the homeless families as well as a prerequisite for lessening the tension between Tutsis and Hutus, between those who fled and those who stayed after the genocide in 1994 and thus eventually a contribution to stability and reconciliation in the larger society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from providing plastic and blankets for thousands in need of temporary shelter ACT member Lutheran World Federation (LWF) is for instance in Eastern Rwanda (Kibungo &amp; Umutara) planning to build or reconstruct 4,500 family houses benefitting an estimated 37.500 people. The construction cost of an average rural house in Rwanda is estimated to be between USD 1,000 to 1, 200. All building materials are purchased locally or regionally if possible and the construction of the houses relies heavily on people themselves taking part in the work serving a double purpose of both creating housing and providing some people with additional skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Western Rwanda similar activities are going on in Kibuye and Gitarama Prefectures along with continued distribution of food and non-food items in 13 districts. All in all the programme in Western Rwanda aims at benefitting 120.000 people and are balanced between the needs of returnees from Zaire and the population who stayed in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. To support these and other projects ACT/LWF is running nine warehouses across Rwanda in addition to a substantial transportation fleet. ACT/NCA in cooperation with the Conseil Protestant du Rwanda (CPR) have shipped 60 tons of blankets and plastic sheeting for immediate distribution to returnees as well as having started a shelter project with 200 houses in Kibungo- Mukarango with local NGO. ACT partner Eglise Episcopale au Rwanda (EER) in cooperation with Christian Aid are planning a shelter programme for 2,700 households in two communes in the Diocese of Byumba as well as distributing 4,000 kitchen sets in the communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACT partners present in Rwanda co-ordinate their activities through a newly established ACT Forum, chaired by Karin Gezelius of ACT/Church of Sweden Aid.  This co-ordination includes CPR (eight local church representatives), LWF, UMCOR, Church World Service, Christian Aid &amp; the Salvation Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania - Burundian refugees still arriving In Tanzania ACT/TCRS is responsible for the camp management for approximately 70.000 Burundian refugees at Mtendeli camp. According to UNHCR there are currently 239.000 Burundian refugees in Ngara, Kibondo and Kasulu districts of Tanzania with about 600 new arrivals daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is likely that close to 90.000 of the Burundian refugees will be moved in the near future from camps around Ngara to the camp at Lumasi left empty by Rwandan refugees in December, 1996. ACT/TCRS have been asked to assist UNHCR in transportation of these refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi - Relief items on hold at border With the civil conflict continuing in many parts of Burundi ACT/Christian Aid along with a number of local churches in Burundi are eagerly awaiting the arrival of seven truckloads of non-food relief items (blankets, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, soap etc). The relief goods are currently held up at the Tanzanian-Burundian border awaiting clearance from the local Tanzanian authorities that oversees the trade embargo on Burundi. Once in Burundi the relief items are to be distributed by local churches to displaced and other needy groups throughout 13 of Burundi's 16 regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding for Great Lakes Region appeals so far Since the latest escalation of the crisis in the Great Lakes Region began in September/October of 1996 ACT International has issued five appeals to fundraise for relief operations aimed at meeting the expanding and changing humanitarian needs in the region.  The three first appeals (AFZR61-63) totaled USD 14,620,897 and they are so far covered up to USD 6,260,854 (43%) by ACT funding members and their back donors. The last two appeals (AFZR64 &amp; AFRW61) totaling USD 4,828,328 were issued just before Christmas 1996 and have so far not been funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the above described programmes and activities depend on funding responses, ACT International are asking all funding members and their back donors as soon as possible to pledge against these apparent needs. Crucial programmes are in danger of coming to a halt if funding is not found. This will have obvious and serious consequences for the beneficiaries through out the Great Lakes Region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Gen. Omar el Bashir alleged that the SPLA rebels were backed by Ethiopian troops which had shelled the two towns, enabling their seizure by the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan's parliament has accused Ethiopia of violating all international norms, charters and principles of good neighborliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament said Monday that the attack was &quot;only a part of the plot&quot; led by countries spearheaded by the United States of America and &quot;Zionist forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This plot, it added, started a long ago and involved an economic embargo, media campaigns aimed at tarnishing Sudan's image, and anti-Khartoum resolutions and sanctions passed and imposed by international organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan is under a limited embargo imposed by the United Nations for its failure to handover, for trial in neighboring Ethiopia, Egyptians who allegedly participated in a bid to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa on 26 June, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese parliament called on all Arab and Moslem states to condemned plots against Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang claimed Monday that the Unified Opposition Forces of North and Southern Sudan, now under his command, had captured the entire Nile Province, which borders Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most prominent Sudanese opposition leader and former prime minister, Sadiq al Mahdi, recently fled into exile in neighboring Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his arrival in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, Mahdi announced that he was joining other externally-based opposition groups seeking to topple Bashir, who overthrew Mahdi's democratically elected government in June 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese officials had minimized the impact of Mahdi's escape, saying this had only helped to cut him off from his supporters in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghana attracted some 300,000 tourists in 1996, yielding an impressive total cash receipt of 248 million U.S dollars, the Ministry of Tourism said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most arrivals were from Ghana's traditional tourism generating markets -- the United States, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana also became a destination for a significant number of tourists from Canada, Switzerland and other European and African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, Ghana received 286,000 visitors and cash receipts of 237 million dollars, the Director of Research and Information at the ministry, Abraham Bekoe, told the Ghana News Agency on Tuesday in Accra.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the sector expected an average tourist inflow of 399,000 annually from now till the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign exchange receipts for tourist arrivals over the next three years, he said, would be an average of 386 million dollars each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry officials say the heaviest influx of tourists into the country in 1997 is expected to occur in March, during the country's 40th independence anniversary celebration and later in August during the Pan-African Historical Theatre Festival, or PANAFEST '97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Bekoe said that apart from these two major attractions, the sector was poised to enjoy a significant increase in tourist traffic, especially from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed optimism at this &quot;because of the impact of the ministry's promotional initiative there, the improvement in direct air links and Ghana's growing image as a tourist destination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One major achievement of the industry in Ghana, he said, was that hotel beds had more than doubled during the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana has about 10,783 hotel beds which the tourism ministry expects to increase significantly by the middle of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At present, more than half of this total -- that is 5,556 -- of our beds are in budget class hotels. But most of the new ones expected this year are all of international standard ranging between two-star and five-star,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of these, he said, that Ghana expected an additional 2,750 beds all over the country by the year 2,010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the new hotels still under construction, such as Accra's Palm Beach Hotel at La, and the Golden Beach Resort at Elmina in the central region are expected to be ready for occupation by June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 168-bed Elmina Golden Beach Resort, owned by the Social Security and National Insurance Trust, is said to be of strategic importance to the August PANAFEST event, to be hosted exclusively in Cape Coast and Elmina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bekoe said the ministry expected 70 percent of all hotel projects and other receptive facilities within the festival zone to be completed before the start of the festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The estimated shortfall of thirty percent in hospitality facilities is expected to be taken care of by other installations outside the immediate activity areas such as Takoradi and hostel facilities at the University of Cape Coast,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bekoe said airline operations in Ghana which previously constituted a major limitation to the growth of tourism, had now picked up impressively, increasing from only nine airlines a few years ago to 15 today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The good thing is that these increases are not just by mere local representation. They are increases reflected in terms of flight frequency,&quot; he said. &quot;Chances are, that very soon, some of these airlines will start operating daily schedules in Ghana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bekoe said the ministry had a 15-year National Tourism Development Programme that will run until 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first phase of the programme, a five-year Tourism Action Plan, was set in motion in late 1996. It embraces various small programmes designed to unearth as well as boost the country's tourism potentials on a regional basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These regional tourism programmes have been so fashioned to correspond with government's commitment to opening up the hinterlands, stimulating rural economies and eventually strengthening district authorities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important feature of the programme is a five-year marketing strategy and promotional programme. This initiative is intended to &quot;sell Ghana as a more rewarding and preferable destination on the highly competitive international tourism market.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The executive-secretary of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Bingu wa Mutharika, accused on Tuesday unnamed &quot; external forces&quot; of working to kill the organization by influencing some member states to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are people out there who are not happy that Africans with black skins can sit down and get success. Unfortunately, we are victim of our own success,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika, a Malawian, was speaking at a news conference in Lusaka, the Zambian capital. He was reacting to announcements by Lesotho and Mozambique that they were withdrawing from the 20-nation common market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the decision by the two countries as a matter of concern to the heads of state and government of the common market, and to himself. He appealed to both nations to re-consider their decision in the name of Pan- Africanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika noted that, unlike the much smaller Southern Africa Development Community, the common market -- also know by its acronym, Comesa -- was not an aid-coordinating agency. Rather, he said, it was a common market with the an objective of promoting regional integration by developing a larger market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comesa is an organization established by Africans, executed by Africans, for Africans,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope that both Mozambique and Lesotho will carefully take full account of medium and long-term development interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed fear that the common market would experience the same fate as the East African Community that grouped Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. This community, which created in 1967, was officially disbanded in 1983 because of political differences among heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mozambique and Lesotho will go around the circle like the East African nations went through and, later, after realizing their mistakes, will come back to cause problems,&quot; Mutharika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed rumors that Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were also planning to withdraw from Comesa to concentrate on the newly-created East African Cooperation Arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he said he was unaware that Namibia was also likely to withdraw. The said that Namibia's withdrawal request had not been officially communicated to Comesa's headquarters in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comesa's Council of Ministers will be meeting later this week in Lusaka.  The council will discuss concrete measures to strengthen the body following the withdrawal of Lesotho and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other 18 Comesa member countries are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comesa was created under a treaty signed in Kampala, Uganda, in late 1994.  It succeeded the Eastern and Southern African Preferential Trade Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana and South africa are the only other Southern African states which have never joined Comesa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 100 Bulawayo and Harare business executives flew on the inaugural flights on the Boeing 727-100 tri-jet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline's public relations manager, Peter Mukuna, said the carrier was leasing the 118-seat American-built jet from Million Air Charter. A second Boeing 727 is to be leased from the South African-based charter company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zex's second aircraft, a 44-seater Hawker, is also being leased from a South African-based company, Executive Aerospace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukuna said the new business express service between Harare and Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's two leading cities, would be mainly to serve the business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ZEX would offer a free flight between the two cities whenever a plane was delayed for more than one hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are giving the most efficient service at an economy fare but most importantly we are saying time is money and the business concept is punctuality for an appointment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (PANA) - Each day at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT), baby gorillas in Brazzaville's zoo are taught by their keepers to jump from one branch to another, and how to select the fruits and plants necessary for their survival in the wilds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After five years of semi-captivity the animals will released into the wilds, a 44,000 hectare (108,724 acres) forested site 120 kilometres (74.56 miles) north to Brazzaville, provided by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rehabilitation of these primates is an initiative of the Congo's Gorillas Protection Unit. The unit was created in 1989 by a British non- governmental organization, Howitts and Port Lympe Foundation, in cooperation with Congolese authorities. The money for the project comes from the NGO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo's Wildlife Conservation Department puts the gorilla population at less than 100 in the north of the country and says that at least two gorillas are killed each month. This is because the animal is a local culinary delicacy, also hunted for its bones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to custom, gorillas' skulls and hands bones are beneficial to man,&quot; The coordinator for the rehabilitation project, Marcel Nguimbi, says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, Congolese tie a gorilla's finger bone around the wrists of their infants and put these bones into bath water in the belief that it will make the child strong and courageous. In addition, gorilla bones are crushed into powder and consumed in the belief that it has aphrodisiac properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baby gorillas are also threatened because they are hunted for sale to tourists at high prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under these circumstances, species preservation is vital to us forest wardens&quot;, Nguimbi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo's rehabilitation of baby gorillas is the first being undertaken, in this country, by its protection unit and 15 staff workers. The staff's task it to retrieve baby gorillas captured by poachers, return the animals to their orphanage and prepare them for their release into the wilds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On of the unit's staff, Naobi Okayasu, form Japan, says: &quot;Our role is to prevent baby gorillas traffic abroad. We receive and cure for them, return them to their natural environment, the forest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 4-6 years of rehabilitation at the Brazzaville zoo, the baby gorillas are released into Lessio Launa Forest Sanctuary. The site is named after the two rivers which run through the forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials say the site is the ideal halfway house for the release of the gorillas into the wilds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The area has no predators. There are only elephants, monkeys, pangolins; and reptiles harmless to gorillas,&quot; they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three generations of gorillas have already been released into this facility.  The first generation comprised six male and three female gorillas between five years and six years old. Three baby gorillas died soon after from natural causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second group of three was released in September 15, 1996. The third, make up of two males and one female, was released eight days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did not have any health problem with the two last groups, as the first experience had taught us the precautions we needed to take,&quot; Nguimbi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the unit is happy at returning the gorillas to their natural environment, some of the keepers have found it hard to part with their wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is true that their return to nature is beneficial to them, but we are sad to see the gorillas going forever, as we consider them as our children and gave a name to each of them,&quot; says Catherine Bibimbou, a keeper who has been with the unit since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In support of their return to the wild, the unit wants Congo to develop tourism in Lessio Louna where visitors could view the animals from the surrounding cliffs or their boats, far from direct contact with man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The area's natural beauty is appropriate for tourism,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ranking African officials will use ships and cars to reach the Libyan capital, Tripoli, for this year's five-day annual budgetary session of the Organization of African Unity, an official said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Momadou Bah, said these measures were necessary if the officials were to avoid violating a United Nations air embargo against Libya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bah, the director of the organization's Political Department, told the Pan African News Agency that the O.A.U. had accepted Libya's invitation to meet in Tripoli beginning Feb. 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The session in Tripoli, he said, would not constitute a breach of the U.N.  sanctions but high attendance would show solidarity with Libya, an O.A.U.  member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no sanction on O.A.U. activities and on the relationships between the O.A.U. and member states,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the organization's first major meeting in Libya since the abortive summit of 1982, which failed to take place twice for lack of a quorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya is under sanctions imposed in April 1992 by the U.N. Security Council, after it failed to hand over for trial in the United States or Britain two of its citizens accused of planting the bomb that blew up a PanAm jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C. (PANA) - The chairmen of Nigeria's five recently registered political parties in Nigeria have asked the National Endowment For Democracy, in Washington D.C., to spread the agency's aid evenly to all of the country's non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of Nigeria's Grassroots Democratic Movement, Alhaji Gambo Lawan, accused the endowment body of limiting its aid to anti-military government groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the agency to aid, also, registered parties which he called the major players in Nigeria's transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's program officer for Africa, Dave Peterson, asked the parties to make proposals for the help they needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied that the agency's grants were intended for the opposition.  However, he said that they were aimed at supporting the process of democracy and human rights through non-governmental efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Endowment For Democracy, formed in 1983, is the principal source of funding for Nigeria's human rights and democracy movements. In 1995, it gave 303,313 U.S dollars to eight such organizations in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian chairmen, who are visiting the United States to explain the three-year transition programme set by the Nigerian military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, made their request Tuesday during a meeting with the endowment's officials in Washington D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. capital was the last stop in the seven-city itinerary of the chairmen, who arrived here Jan. 4. They visited New York, Atlanta, Houston, Chicago, Miami and Kansas City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group held meetings with Nigerians and Americans to convince them of the genuiness of the transition process, announced by Abacha in October 1995.  The process is expected to end in October 1998 with the installation of an elected head of state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere said Wednesday African leaders needed to understand the realities of the continent's Great Lakes region before trying to solve its political and security crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happens in Burundi will also affect Rwanda and Zaire...Africa should understand that and help the region using this kind of understanding,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking to reporters shortly after an hour-long meeting with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, in Harare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere said that Rwanda's crisis, which revolves around the arrest and trial of Hutu militants accused of the 1994 atrocities against the country's minority Tutsi, needed to be dealt with at the leadership level and with the help of the Arusha tribunal. The tribunal is holding in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere said that Rwanda stood a much better chance of national reconciliation between its two warring communities than did Burundi, where the same ethnic mix and volatile problems exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Burundi, he said, international sanctions had failed to force the country's military leaders to re-establish democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (sanctions) didn't work that effectively but they at least helped in the sense that they had created an environment to open dialogue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subregion, he said, was involved in ethnic turmoil. For example in Burundi, where Nyerere is the chief mediator, at least 150,000 people -- mainly civilians -- have been massacred in the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere also met Tuesday with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, wanting to learn from the country's experience in conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1992 and 1994 Mozambique, with United Nations assistance, moved remarkably smoothly from a devastating war to multiparty elections whose results were accepted by all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of Nyerere's talks with Chissano were not released. But Nyerere's visit came a few days after Burundian border police reportedly massacred refugees who had just been sent home from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing has been deplored by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He called for a cease-fire in Burundi, which has been under turmoil since the October 1993 assassination of the democratically-elected President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndadaye's brutal death touched-off Hutu revenge killings against the Tutsi, whose leader, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, returned to power July 25, 1996, in a coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere said while Rwanda was recovering, it could not do so fully without the help of the rest of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe is one of the four African leaders chosen at a summit in December 1996, to find lasting solutions to the political and ethnic problems of the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other members of the group, chaired by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, are South African President Nelson Mandela and the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity, Cameroonian President Paul Biya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - The heads of the African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are opposed to agricultural subsidies currently being applied by governments in Africa and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In plenary Thursday at the ongoing World Food Summit, the presidents of both institutions said subsidies had contributed to lower incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently well-intentioned but misguided practices&quot; aimed at cheap food prices for urban consumers through subsidies had only exacerbated the problem of lower farm incomes, ADB President Omar Kabbaj said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsidies, he added, &quot;contributed to the marginalization of the rural economy and to declines in the income and welfare of rural dwellers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And World Bank President James Wolfensohn told a news conference &quot;no country, in the long term, can live with subsidies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier he told world leaders at the summit that governments &quot;should reduce heavy intervention in the rural economy and concentrate on creating an economic and regulatory environment that fosters agricultural growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Kabbaj and Wolfensohn said that the reduction of subsidies tended to nudge farmers to areas which are more efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To compliment this, both banks have adopted new approaches to rid the poor countries of the worst types of poverty, providing mocro-financing to allow for easy credit for farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabbaj said ADB provides micro-credit to poor and vulnerable groups and has been giving credit to national and sub-regional development finance bodies so they could, in turn, lend to small and medium-scale enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both banks have also been working with or have policies in place to collaborate with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), who have considerable experience in implementing poverty alleviation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be making further strides in this area, with the finalization of a new micro-enterprise policy which will set the framework for extending appropriate credit to the poorest groups, using financial intermediaries such as NGOs and other grassroots organizations,&quot; Kabbaj said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have initially set aside some 20 million dollars (U.S) for this type of support.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said at a news briefing in Kinshasa on Thursday that the crisis in eastern Zaire was partly caused by the non-respect of the decisions of a national conference held four years ago by the political class.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference named Tshisekedi Prime Minister but the latter was relieved of the post months later by Mobutu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a demonstration of his firm believe in national unity, the three major tribes of multi-ethnic Nigeria -- the Hausas in the north, the Yorubas in the west, especially Lagos, and the Igbos in the east, have sought to outdo each other in paying glowing tributes to the former president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has told South African President Nelson Mandela that it is &quot;impossible&quot; to postpone Monday's elections since the 11 opposition parties participating in the elections have opposed postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter, dated 14 Nov. to Mandela which was made available to PANA Friday, he also said that the proposition to postpone the elections was totally impossible because of the &quot;astronomical&quot; costs incurred spent by the participating parties and in view of limited resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Postponement of the elections scheduled for next monday 18 November, 1996 is a totally impossible proposition which the principal opposition parties taking part in the elections have also said they will not accept,&quot; part of the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba maintained there is no threat to the internal security and stability to warrant a draconian move like a state of emergency, as suggested, to facilitate the postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela early this week held private consultations with Chiluba in Pretoria.  He later sent South African constitutional court judge Richard Goldstone to explore possibilities of postponing the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Zambia Democratic Congress, (ZDC) which is one of the political parties taking part in the elections, confirmed to PANA that it had refused to accept the suggestion of postponing the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not for the idea of extending the elections,&quot; said the party's general secretary, Derrick Chitala. &quot;We had made it clear that we would only agree if we were compensated the money spent on elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian government has terminated its multibillion-dollar contract with the Russian firm, TPE, for the construction of a steel complex at Ajaokuta, in the center of the country, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1983 completion date of the five-billion-dollar contract conceived in the 1960s to launch Nigeria into industrial age has not been met because of operational hitches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, several units of the complex have been completed for the production of rods and other steel and foundry products in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAN said that work at the main gigantic project site had reached 98 percent completion before the termination of the contract with TPE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm had already been paid some 50 billion naira (about 625 million U.S.  dollars) for the work done but some bills are outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inadequate working capital and shortage of raw materials were said to be delaying the remaining part of the construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency quoted the Russians as saying they could only resume work if a rail line was completed to ease the transportation of raw materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of Nigeria's Federal Power and Steel Ministry, supervising the project, said there had been consultations between the Nigerian and Russian officials on how to settle the outstanding debts owed the Russian contractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, some 8,000 Nigerian junior employees of the firm, launched a violent strike, demanding the payment of their salaries. This caused substantial damage to property at the steel complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The riot led to a mass sacking of the strikers and re-organization of the management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Remarks by State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns at the daily briefing on January 15 on the U.S. response to reports of a possible South African arms sale to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Just to ask a question for South African Broadcasting. What's your reaction to comments made by Nelson Mandela's spokesman today that he's disgusted - detests the kind of behavior the American government offered - the (South African) Government's reaction to your comments to what's happening in South Africa and is insulted by the American Government's attempt to hold a gun to South Africa's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: My goodness, I haven't seen those remarks, but I can just say that we have a very good relationship with the Government of South Africa, and I'm sure that will continue, because our heads of state have a good personal relationship, and we've been able to do a lot of business with South Africa. We want to continue that.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We said yesterday that in light of the allegations and reports that South Africa was considering a substantial arms sale to Syria, which is a terrorist state under U.S. law, that we were worried about that. We were concerned by it. We would raise this issue with the South African Government. We have done so in both Pretoria and in Washington. We'll continue to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also said yesterday that we didn't have all the facts on this, and that part of our effort right now was to seek the facts from the South African Government, and we will do that. We're working on it, and you can rest assured that we'll continue to take this issue very seriously, because we have to be concerned about the application of American law here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the United States Government is not going to make any decision and cannot make a decision on this issue until we get all the facts from the South African Government. I would suggest that we do that amicably and cooperatively in the tradition that we've established with the Mandela Government over the past couple of years, and that's how you'll see us talk about this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I thought there had been deterioration in relations between America and South Africa, with those sort of comments saying, &quot;What we find particularly insulting is for someone to hold a gun to our head and tell us what to do.&quot; Does the threat to withdraw the $82 million of aid still stand if this arms deal does go ahead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I would encourage you to look very carefully at what I said yesterday. I will tell you, I was a little bit surprised to see the way that some news organizations covered my remarks and Mike McCurry's remarks yesterday. Both of us talked about the fact that we were aware of allegations; that we'd raised these allegations with the South African Government, and that we would continue to do that. It was a very serious issue, because it was a matter of law here, and it also is tied to the international fight against terrorism, Syria being a state sponsor of terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we were very careful to say that we didn't have all the facts, and that obviously we're going to be talking to the South African Government before anything happens here. We hope very much that they would not go forward with any proposed sale. So I think that these were measured comments yesterday. No one's putting a gun to anyone's head, and we intend to work with the South African Government amicably and cooperatively on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, can you explain the nature of the contact between the United States and Pretoria? I mean, did you call on the Ambassador here? When did that happen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't know specifically at what level this issue was raised. I did check, and I know that it was raised both with the South African Embassy here in Washington, and also our Embassy went in to see the South African Foreign Ministry in Pretoria. I don't know if our Ambassador or their Ambassador were involved in these discussions in the two capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Did that happen today or -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I think it's happened in recent days, and those contacts preceded the press reports. We've been aware of this for some time - not for a long time, but for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But there were no contacts in the last 24 hours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I suppose there were contacts in the past 24 hours. I don't know every time an American diplomat talks to a South African diplomat. I'm sure there were contacts in recent days because this is a prominent issue. It's in the news. We've said that we're seriously concerned by it and we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I just wondered, after your remarks yesterday whether there had been any contacts in which the South Africans may have said to you, &quot;We don't understand the nature of our sale,&quot; or said anything -- provided you with any information that perhaps alleviated some of your concerns?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't believe we have yet received - I think we're in the process of receiving from the South African Government a full description of what may or may not be in the works. Until we receive a full description, we're not going to be able to determine the relevance of this issue to U.S.  law and, frankly, the degree of seriousness of this issue. But I do want to repeat again today what we said yesterday. We don't believe that countries should provide military assistance to state sponsors of terrorism, Syria being clearly one of those states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - COSATU welcomes the new Mine Health &amp; Safety Act which was announced by Minister Maduna today. The Act heralds South Africa's commitment to international labour standards as it is in line with the ILO convention on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU played a key role in the ILO convention, and last year put pressure on the government to ratify this convention. We believe they will be doing so this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Act is a great victory for South African mineworkers who have been struggling for decades to get reliable health and safety measures implemented on the mines. The RDP refers to this issue when it says: &quot;The RDP envisages a new set of minimum standards for the mining industry that ensures fair wages and employment conditions for all workers and a health and safety system that recongnises the special hazards related to mining_4.5.1.10&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mineworkers have long been urging government to investigate the situation on the mines, and in 1991, under the leadership of the National Union of Mineworkers, they initiated the appointment of a commission on mine health and safety. The commission criticised the implementation of safety measures on mines in this country which have resulted in national tragedies such as the Vaal Reef mine disaster of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mineworkers are faced daily with extremely difficult work situations, constantly threatened by the possibility of terrible deaths as a result of rock falls, mud-slides and other mining related horrors. It is estimated that nearly two miners die every day in South African mines - 80 percent of those being in the gold mines. The lack of training in the past has often meant that preventable accidents have recurred instead of being avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU believes this new law will introduce a more humane and caring attitude in the mining industry. It is crucial that a democratic country protects its workforce - particularly those workers who take great risks on a daily basis in order to sustain one of the key areas of our economy. Again the RDP is clear when it says: &quot;Our principle objective is to transform mining and mineral-processing industries to serve all of our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU therefore welcomes the introduction of this new Act. We urge all mines to take heed of the Act and to implement efficient and reliable health and safety measures with immediate effect!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issued by COSATU Communications Department on behalf of the General Secretary. January 15, 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States deplores the recent violence in Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian Army has confirmed the January 10 killing of over 120 Burundian Hutu returnees, who had reportedly been expelled from Tanzania the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This massacre is only part of a pattern of violence in Burundi which must cease. Only the day before, witnesses implicated the army in the massacre of more than 80 civilians on January 5 in rural Muramvya Province. The army has also been involved in a practice of forced resettlement, by which Burundians in rural areas, mostly poor farmers, are forced to move into camps. Rebel groups have also been accused of human rights abuses. We understand that soldiers involved in the January 10 incident have been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States continues to call for a cease-fire and all-party talks to restore stability to Burundi. Special envoy Howard Wolpe has travelled extensively in the region working for a cease-fire, returning from Burundi, Tanzania and Kenya over the weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris - Health and nutritional situation of the Rwandan refugees in Tingi- Tingi camp, Zaire:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tingi-Tingi camp is located 10 km from Lubutu and 200 km from Kisangani, North-Eastern Zaire. The camp is hosting an estimated 120,000 Rwandan refugees coming from former camps in Bukavu area and who fled the fighting between the Zairian army and Banyamulengue rebels last October, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An epidemiologic surveillance system was implemented in Tingi-Tingi by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and Epicentre. Daily crude mortality rates (CMR) have been regularly increasing for the last 3 weeks, reaching 4/10, 000/day between January 6 and 13, 1997 (alert threshold 1/10,000/day). 54% of the deaths occurred in children under five. Under-five mortality showed the same trend as CMR and reached 10/10,000/day between January 6 and 13 (alert threshold 2/10,000/day).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main causes of death are malnutrition, diarrhoea and malaria. As of January 13, 200 children had been admitted to intensive feeding centers (weight-for- height below 3 Z-scores or oedema), and more than 1,800 children were given supplementary food rations. The nutritional situation is expected to further deteriorate since general food distribution is grossly insufficient: 7O tons would be necessary each day while only 30 tons are actually (available to be) distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acute diarrhoea accounted for 15% of outpatient attendance. As of January 13, 32 adult diarrhoea cases presented with severe dehydration, vomiting and other clinical symptoms of cholera. Stool samples were sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris for analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria accounted for 40% of outpatient attendance. Cerebral malaria is the main cause of death in adults. Since the camp is located in a high endemicity area, while the refugee population probably has a low level of immunity against P. falciparum, the situation might again deteriorate during the rainy season which is now starting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF, UNICEF and WFP (World Food Programme) are the only international organisations presently operating in Tingi-Tingi. The distribution of an adequate food ration to the entire population of the camp is at the top of today's health priorities. Strengthening surveillance and implementing control measures against acute diarrhoea and malaria would also be necessary for reducing excess mortality in the refugee population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - LAST weekend thousands of fans jammed their way into Independence Stadium, a decaying concrete bowl perched on a windswept hillside just north of Lusaka. They were there in the hope that Zambia could defeat South Africa in a vital qualifying game for the 1998 World Cup. The game ended in a draw much to their disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those unable to afford the few kwacha needed for admission were also there, anxious to soak up the atmosphere, to be part of a great game. As kick-off approached they tuned their crackling, battered radios to the match commentary and made their way down a grassy slope to a brick-walled enclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For once the heavy metal gates were open, the high walls offering protection from the dust blowing in off the valley floor. For those not able to watch the game, this is perhaps the next best place to be, a football shrine in the true sense. Arranged in a semi-circle around a plain stone obelisk are the graves of 30 men. They died when a Zambian Air Force plane carrying the national team to a 1993 World Cup qualifier in Senegal crashed in darkness off the coast of Gabon. Eighteen players were killed - the cream of this soccer-crazy nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly four years later, the crash still reverberates: the pain, loss and grief. The South African match is overshadowed by the continuing refusal of the Zambian government to release the report of the inquiry into the causes of the disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doreen Mankinka was only 23 when she was left widowed with three children, the youngest only a month old. Her husband Derby had won numerous caps during a nine-year international career. By playing abroad, in Saudi Arabia, he had ensured a good standard of living for his family. But his death has left an irreconcilable void. &quot;I need to know what killed my husband,&quot; she says. &quot;I never viewed my husband's body. I never saw it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a financial as well as emotional limbo. Life insurance is unknown to many Africans, and when Derby died all Doreen Mankinka had to fall back on was the money raised by public appeal: three million kwacha given to each victim's family. Shared, according to African custom, with her husband's parents, it was soon gone, forcing Doreen and children to leave their comfortable home in a Lusaka suburb to move in with her parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only government contribution to the appeal fund was 10 million kwacha, a donation from the minister of sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the tragedy, it was decided to carry on with the campaign to qualify for USA '94. Ian Porterfield, hero of Sunderland's 1973 FA Cup victory, was appointed coach. The makeshift team nearly achieved a fairytale ending. Needing a draw in their last game away to Morocco, they lost to a late goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government investigation established by President Frederick Chiluba was under way but the victims' families still await its verdict. Promised dates for publication of the report repeatedly come and go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time when Peggy Mwape would not have missed a match like the South Africa game for anything, but now she can no longer bring herself to watch football. Her husband Michael, a prosperous businessman and chairman of the Zambian FA, died alongside the players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His widow continues the campaign to uncover the facts of the disaster. &quot;I think there is something the government is hiding,&quot; she says. &quot;From what I know, the government can't tell the country the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information that Peggy Mwape alludes to concerns the condition of the Zambian Air Force Buffalo aircraft used to fly the squad to Dakar. Her fear of a cover-up raises few eyebrows in a country once considered a showpiece for democratic development in Africa but where suppression of information has become increasingly commonplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodson Machona is sports editor of The Post, an independent newspaper with a track record of washing the government's dirty laundry in public. Its offices are bugged and its journalists harassed, but it continues to worry at the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machona claims a Gabonese journalist told him of the findings of that country's investigation. &quot;The Gabonese authorities told the pilots not to take off at night because it (the aircraft) was not airworthy. But they wanted to get to Senegal so they ignored the advice and took off.&quot; This alleged negligence, if true, would explain the Zambian government's reluctance to publish the findings of their own inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year was an election year, with parliamentary and presidential polls in November. Any revelation that the government was responsible for the deaths of the footballers would have had catastrophic political consequences for the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those raised on Match of the Day and the occasional trip to a rain- swept Football League ground, it is difficult to understand the role and influence of football in Africa. In a continent riven with conflict, where politicians seldom remain untainted by corruption, there are few heroes, fewer distractions. Football fills the void, providing hope in a desert of poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lacking generous sponsors and lucrative TV deals, Zambian soccer is beholden to the government if it is to compete internationally. Even after the cadging of a lift from an Air Force transport plane ended so disastrously the Zambian FA remains squirmingly tight-lipped and faithful to its paymaster.  The FAZ secretary-general Julio Chiluba (no relation) fends off inquiries about the suppressed report with a tired &quot;can't comment, it's a government matter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no compensation payable until and unless the government admits liability, the families of the victims feel betrayed by the authorities.  Peggy Mwape was lucky - she has successfully taken up the reins of her husband's petrol station and grocery business - but others are less fortunate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Doreen Mankinka, life is a continual struggle, fitting in a full-time job and the demands of motherhood with her studies in public relations at college. Still young, she hopes for a new career, one that will enable her to afford a home for her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derby's photo looks down on her from a sideboard in her in-laws' cramped front room as she revises for exams. Her face, tense in concentration, has the lines of a woman 10 years older.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publication of the government's inquiry report is essential if she and her children are to put the tragedy behind them and move on. &quot;They keep asking me what killed their father,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't know what to say. If that report is out they will be able to go on with life. Let them give us the report, then we can forget about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being overwhelmingly re-elected, albeit amid allegations of vote- fixing, President Chiluba has once again promised the report will be published shortly. Perhaps, with the election safely behind him, he will keep his word this time. But the victims' families no longer trust his assurances and are going to court to force the report's release and a compensation settlement. They had hoped for a hearing in December but are still awaiting a date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime the World Cup quest continues. No sponsor could be found to pay for television coverage of the first qualifying game, away to Congo a few days before the elections. So groups of men huddled around ancient wirelesses all over the country, straining to hear the commentator through the static.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a lull in the game, which Zambia lost to an 86th-minute goal, one of them expressed fear about the report's publication. &quot;It will bring conflict to this country,&quot; he said. &quot;So many people love soccer, they hate what happened. If they bring out that report it will bring disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Peggy Mwape, Doreen Mankinka and all the families of those who died, the best memorial would be the truth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IN Glasgow it's Rangers and Celtic, in Liverpool Everton and Liverpool, in London Arsenal and Tottenham, in Milan AC and Inter, in Cairo Zamalek and Al-Ahly, and in South Africa Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.  There is nothing to quicken the pulse of a soccer supporter like a local derby and the fact that tension often strangles skill does nothing to diminish pre-match expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday afternoon in the unusual surrounds of Ellis Park, the rugby stadium where the Amabokoboko conquered the world less than two years ago, the Amakhosi and the Buccaneers do battle again. The match is being staged at the home of Transvaal rugby because Chiefs enjoy home advantage and say FNB Stadium is Pirates's home ground. The black and gold brigade usually perform at Johannesburg Stadium, whose 40 000-capacity is too small for the occasion.  It's the first of two 1996-1997 Castle Premiership clashes between the teams and a highly significant match for championship pacesetters Chiefs and fifth- placed Pirates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Chiefs fail to collect the three points awarded for a victory, Manning Rangers would take over top spot in a league offering prizes totalling R2,4-million by winning at QwaQwa Stars 24 hours later. Pirates trail their greatest rivals by 12 points largely due to erratic away form which led to defeats against modest opponents Wits, Real Rovers and Bloemfontein Celtic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They do have two matches in hand on the leaders, however, and success this weekend would leave them well positioned to mount a serious challenge for the R500 000 first prize. The club winning the first Castle Premiership will also be eligible for the 1998 African Champions Cup, where a club can pocket R2- million by reaching the decider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like all derbys, form is usually more of a hindrance than a help, and the fact that Pirates humiliated Chiefs 4-1 in the Bob Save Super Bowl semi- finals last November can be confined to the scrapbooks of history. Pirates tormentor-in-chief Jerry Sikhosana will be hoping to build on his 30- minute hat-trick, but one of the defenders he persecuted, Chiefs captain Neil Tovey, must watch from the sideline. Tovey, outstanding for Bafana Bafana in the World Cup draw with Zambia last weekend, is suspended, adding to the concerns of veteran Brazilian-born coach Walter da Silva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiefs may boast the best defensive record in the Premiership with only five goals conceded in 13 matches, but the thought of facing Pirates without the national captain can only heighten anxiety within the Amakhosi camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last encounter with Pirates, Chiefs could have conceded eight had young goalkeeper Brian Baloyi not been in the sort of form that has seen him knocking ever louder on the Bafana Bafana door. The tactics of recently departed Pirates coach Victor Bondarenko were simple and devastatingly effective that day: play the ball into vacant space outside Chiefs' penalty area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forced to advance from their comfort zones, Chiefs' defenders were found lacking in pace and strength and Sikhosana had a field day before Helman Mkhalele completed the rout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiefs missed injured Jacob Tshisevhe that boiling hot afternoon (in more ways than one) and he will be back to reinforce a defence likely to include Lifa Gqosha, Cleophas Dlodlo and Ntsie Maphike. Much was made in the media about Chiefs' woeful defending against the rampant Buccaneers, but the gentlemen who must share the blame surprisingly escaped largely unscatched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If midfielders don't tackle, and Isaac Kungoane, David Modise and Thabang Lebese are reluctant practitioners at the best of times, the pressure on the defence can quickly reach breaking point. South Africa desperately needs multipurpose midfielders like Nigerians Jay Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Finidi George and Nwankwo Kanu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just look at Bafana Bafana where Innocent Buthelezi and Eric Tinkler trade largely on muscle while the more skilful Doctor Khumalo and &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu are not exactly renowned for full-blooded tackling. That is not to say that Pirates are perfect either in this crucial area, but in young Dumisa Ngobe they have arguably the closest to a typical Nigerian midfielder, a player with brain and brawn. Midfield is where this showdown will be won and lost (or drawn if everyone cancels everyone out) and Ngobe should be supported by captain John Moeti and Mkhalele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Sikhosana can hardly hope for another hat-trick, even in his wildest dreams, Pollen Ndlanya will be anxious to escape the clutches of Gavin Lane more often than during the cup tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndlanya, a late substitute for Sikhosana in Zambia to win his first cap, might as well have stayed at home, so seldom did he win the ball against arguably the best uncapped player in the country. And if the sight of Baloyi between the posts brings a smile to Chiefs' army of supporters, Nigerian Williams Okpara has few equals in South Africa when in top form, which happens to be most of the time. So many stars, so many potential scenarios.  The only certainty really is that 68 000 supporters will fill Ellis Park for the latest round in the ultimate South African soccer passion play.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THERE is no real mystery about an umbrella being turned inside out by a sudden, unexpected gust of wind. Cricketing fortunes surely must work on this same inverted parabola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it has been with the current test series against Sachin Tendulkar's Indian tourists that reaches its finale at the Wanderers this weekend. The errant winds of the game which blew South Africa into the doldrums of a first series defeat since re-admittance on their tour of the subcontinent, have shifted to a new quarter at home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in this vein, it is surely only the foolish who still believe that the Earth is flat and that there is nothing new under the sun. For, if David Johnson can start to reconstruct a bowling career on the flat Springbok Park wicket against Free State after it had seemingly sunk without trace on a Kingsmead track made for seamers, anything is surely possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, too, Anil Kumble who has laboured long and hard at his craft on tour with little success. While he would be the first to disclaim ownership of physique such as that of the mythical Hercules, he has, like the god of legend, had to get his hands dirty in an attack that has been one of the singular weaknesses of the Indians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years ago, when India first toured this country, Kumble was beginning to emerge as the fine international bowler he has subsequently become. The South Africans were forced, on that occasion, to treat him with more than a little circumspection. This trip has been less fruitful, and yet, throughout, there has been the feeling that Kumble will come good. The Wanderers could just be the venue for the start of that renaissance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is worth restating the obvious to say that in Venkatesh Prasad and Javagal Srinath, Tendulkar has two fine seam bowlers, a pair worthy of opening the bowling for any Test-playing country in the world. But, sadly, it has largely begun and ended right there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there can be a criticism of Tendulkar's captaincy - and it is well to remember that he is only 23 and new to the business end of leadership - it has been his reticence to spell his main weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have shouldered the burden imposed on them with a stoicism of resolve that has been quite admirable, but there remains the thought that, even if the back-up had conceded runs during their spells, it would have been a better tactic to have bowled them in short bursts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an even more pressing imperative on the bouncy Wanderers track where the altitude, which was not a factor at either Kingsmead or Newlands, becomes a real concern when the warhorses of the game have to charge in and deliver through two full innings over five days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more especially in the case of the Indians when they have both a triangular series against the hosts and Zimbabwe to follow, and then a date with the rapidly re- emerging power of the West Indians to think about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Hansie Cronje has had a far better armoury available to him at the South African helm. Yet, even with what was abundantly available to him, he has re- affirmed his mark as a captain by using his bowling both imaginatively and judiciously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, a side which can boast Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock, Brian McMillan and Lance Klusener is not short of bowling by any standards. And this does not even bring the back-wrenching wiles of Paul Adams or Cronje's own talents with the ball into consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examine, for a moment, the individual merits of the four-pronged pace attack during this series. Donald has been at his most impressive and, at times, unplayable; Pollock continues on the path to international stardom, using his height and the bounce he generates to full advantage; McMillan has been the inestimably valuable player he invariably is - having shaken off the malaise of the Indian sub-continent - and Klusener exudes such raw aggression and delivers such pace that you can almost feel the atmosphere fizz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klusener has come in for some stick from Tendulkar and the elegantly wristy Mohammad Azharuddin. It is to be expected when one learning his trade faces men who have mastered theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cronje is to be congratulated on the way he has used the new man in the side, persevering with him under fire and coaxing him gently when he has begun to gain the ascendancy. Klusener will be with us for some while. His ability with the bat adds to that observation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of bowlers has been the distinct difference between the two captains in many respects, though it is worthy of note that the Indian top order - shuffled as it has been to repair the leaks - has been markedly more brittle than its South African equivalent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, Cronje has been helped enormously by the introduction of Adam Bacher into the side, a selection that has removed, to a large extent, the pressure from Gary Kirsten and Andrew Hudson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has meant that there is some much-needed security about the No 3 position and has given Cronje the enviable option of being able to open the innings with any combination of the three at the top of the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One also feels that it gave Hudson - a batsman of considered class, despite his unrelenting critics - the confidence to rebuild his form with those marvellously gritty match-winning half centuries at Kingsmead. It is one of those mysteries of cricket that Hudson, the most uncomplaining and gentlemanly of men, should attract such bile from the sidelines. He deserves none of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the captain is fighting his own battle to come back to form with the bat, renewed faith in the batting above him has doubtless removed a lot of personal pressure as well. Cronje admitted earlier in the week that captaincy does take a huge and unremitting amount of his concentration. Thus, any lifting of the pressure is to be held as securely as an opportunity to McMillan in the slips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Cronje, this South African side is a fine combination suitably bolstered by the fact that players of experience and worth such as Jonty Rhodes and Craig Matthews are there to call on at any time, and a host of as yet untried youngsters wait eagerly in the wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has all made for an intriguing series and, while the Indians may have felt the rough end of this particular stick in the process, has given them the opportunity to blood some fine young players under the fire of the African sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saurav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid are both batsmen with futures that will hopefully benefit from this tour and bring them back to South Africa more experienced, rounded and ready for the likes of Donald &amp; Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tendulkar, while the quick-fire loss of the series must have been bitter herbs indeed, cannot be too disquietened by the potential displayed by some of his younger players. For him, there has been the fact that cricket seldom produces the expected. But there has also been the sight of the edge of the elusive and problematic parabola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE SPIRITS SPEAK: One Woman's Mystical Journey into the African Spirit World by Nicky Arden (Henry Holt, R103,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BORN in Durban, Nicky Arden emigrated to the United States in the 1960s, disillusioned with apartheid South Africa. On a visit home, she met a sangoma who told her she was being called by the spirits to be a healer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later Arden sought out and was accepted as a candidate sangoma. She describes the process of her training in great detail - including her many questions and doubts, and her experience of two contradictory worlds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the book gets into the emotional tangles of white guilt, it becomes annoying. When it sticks to the narrative and deals unsentimentally with Arden's relationship with Joyce, her teacher, it is both fascinating and quite moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the worst part of the book is all the hype given it on the dust jacket. Its awfully sensational, quite naive and - if the blurb truly suggests that Durban is a &quot;small seaport town&quot; - misleading . The book itself is far, far better and well worth a read, particularly for those of us who are perhaps completely ignorant (and often quite prejudiced) about African traditional healers and their significance for many South Africans today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Admiring Silence by Abdulrazak Gurnah (Hamish Hamilton, R109, 95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the strange enchantments of his Booker-shortlisted Paradise - set in an East Africa on the brink of World War I - Abdulrazak Gurnah's new novel grapples with an African-English present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In crisis, an unnamed schoolteacher in south London takes stock of his life.  With only a precarious sense of belonging, he is assailed by intimations of mortality (a &quot;buggered heart&quot;, in his doctor's helpful diagnosis); a crumbling relationship; and a change of leadership in Zanzibar that prompts an anxious visit &quot;home&quot; after 20 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is Gurnah's most unreliable narrator to date. He embroiders romanticised childhood tales to woo a fellow student, Emma Willoughby, and baits her Blimpish father with ludicrously parodic &quot;Empire stories&quot;. His biggest lie paves the way for abject farce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novel's outrage at the &quot;petty hardships&quot; of Africa and its satire on obscenely self- serving leaders is uncompromising. Yet Gurnah is acutely aware of the hazards of raging against post-colonial Africa - the &quot; overcharged ironies&quot; in labelling those in charge &quot;cannibal louts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His hero's pandering fictions to the Willoughbys reflect the dilemma of the writer coming from what he terms with irony the &quot;darker corners of the world&quot;: to play up to expectations of the &quot;exotic&quot; with anodyne nostalgia, or risk confirming bigotry through harsh realism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author's own choice is clear: &quot;We keep silent and nod - for fear of our lives - while bloated tyrants fart and stamp on us for their petty gratification.&quot; It is tyrants who commend muteness in their subjects, like the ayatollah with his fatwa - &quot;another admirer of silence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the hero's stories also have a self- protective function. They shield him from guilt and recrimination and from the wounding power of words. His traumatic visit home banishes fearful silences within himself and his family, as he overcomes the obtuse resentments of childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its biting humour, Admiring Silence is in some ways a muted novel, an anguished meditation on home and loss that refuses the comfort of resolution. While it eloquently charts the cumulative changes wrought by geographical displacement, it also reveals the loss of love as a kind of exile.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Anglo-Zulu War: The War Correspondents by John Laband and Ian Knight (Jonathan Ball, R89,99)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the war in Vietnam an American reporter found himself stranded in a forward position with a platoon of US soldiers. As night came the officer in charge ordered his men to dig foxholes: an attack was expected. He gave the reporter a rifle and told him to be ready to use it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporter's protest that he was a journalist, not a soldier, drew the angry reply: &quot;When the fucking Vietcong come storming through here they're not going to stop to ask if you're a fucking reporter. They'll kill you with all of us.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporter took the rifle and climbed into a foxhole. No attack came, but he spent the night, frightened and miserable, pondering the ethics of his profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His experience was a long way from the enthusiastic British correspondent in South Africa in 1879 who reported sitting on top of a wagon during a battle and &quot;steadily taking pot-shots&quot; at the attacking Zulu fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moral doubt of the American in Vietnam did not exist in the second half of the last century when war reporting was in its infancy. Professional reporting of conflict had begun in earnest during the Crimean War of the 1850s and soon became a growth industry because of the dozens of British colonial wars of that era and the appetite for news about them among the rapidly growing number of newspaper and magazine readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men who specialised in writing about war were not shy to report critically about the way in which campaigns were conducted. Yet their presence was welcomed because their reports, much like those of many modern war correspondents, were usually intended to fuel and satisfy the patriotic fervour and pride of the readers at home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full-time reporters, known as &quot;special correspondents&quot;, were a swashbuckling elite who projected a sense of romanticism with their semi- military uniforms and wide- brimmed hats. They were complemented by local writers who often remained anonymous because they were serving army officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few of the reporting stars came to South Africa when it became clear that war against the Zulus was inevitable: Britain instructed Sir Bartle Frere, its high commissioner, to bring about a confederation of the region's white- ruled countries under the British crown; Frere viewed the Zulu kingdom as an obstacle and was determined to crush it as a military threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He contrived a pretext for invasion and on January 12 1879 British and colonial forces, a mixture of whites and blacks, crossed the Tugela River - described by a correspondent as &quot;the frontier which divides the civilised domains of Queen Victoria from the savage domains of King Cetywayo (Cetshwayo)&quot;. In the same vein of justification of the imperialist venture the report spoke of men &quot;gathered there to vindicate the just cause of an offended civilisation, and to assert the outraged authority of the British crown&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British leaders and the settlers thought it was going to be a pushover, with soldiers and militias armed with the latest rifles and backed by artillery and the new deadly Gatling machine-guns ranged against Zulu warriors carrying assegais and shields. The Zulus did have guns - perhaps as many as 20 000 - but these were outdated and largely ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once across the frontier, few Zulus were seen and complacency set in. A few days later, on January 22, came the shock of Isandlwana, when the Zulus wiped out 1 300 of the invaders. Journalists rushed from Britain to cover a conflict in which British military pride was suddenly at stake. With them came the &quot;special artists&quot; whose graphic drawings from the field on occasion also presented their own efforts in an heroic light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only a matter of time before superior weapons won: Zulu power was destroyed at Ulundi on July 4 1879, and the kingdom was dismembered.  Cetshwayo was tracked down and captured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling these seminal events in South African history through the eyes and words of the correspondents gives them a human scale. The reports are mainly one-sided, prejudiced and arrogant, but they are vivid and give a feeling of what it was like from day to day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The correspondents' reports are linked by a text provided by John Laband and Ian Knight. It is helpful and informative in setting the context of the times but could have benefited from the editing skills of a modern journalist to deal with ponderous language, repetition and inconsistencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two authors also seem to suffer from some personal insecurity. Laband carries the title of professor on the cover as though he needs to be given extra weight. Knight's name features frequently in credits for the book's many fine contemporaneous drawings and photographs - as though he were responsible for them instead of just being the collector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blemishes apart, however, this book is a lively contribution to knowing our history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Pogrund is a former deputy editor of the Rand Daily Mail. His book on that newspaper will be published later this year</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Peter Greenaway has never made a less than accomplished film, but nor is he ever likely to make one that's fully comprehensible at first sight, which is a bit of problem for your average film-goer. The Pillow Book, however, is a distinct advance on his last, The Baby Of Macon, since its subject matter chimes in so extraordinarily well with Greenaway's concern for detail and the expressiveness of decoration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visually it is a constant treat. What's there dovetails almost perfectly with the properly erotic concerns of the film, which are sex and power and the relevance of the past to the present and future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hardly possible to synopsise the story. It concerns Nagito, daughter of a famous calligrapher, who is married off at 18 to a dull archery enthusiast and runs away to Hong Kong, where she leads a successful modelling career. Obsessed with the way her father wrote on her body, she seeks out lovers who will do the same. An Englishman she meets suggests she writes on her lovers' bodies instead, and an obsessed photographer wants to take the results to a homosexual publisher, who once had sex with her father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenaway traverses this weird story with a sensuous appreciation of the power of sex and a determination to display the narrative in novel forms.  What he has achieved is an impressive look at how the past, present and future match as we stride towards the millennium with rather less certain footsteps than his own and a little less poetry in, or on, our bodies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Watching Brett Bailey's Zombie in the middle of Nyanga was not nearly as esoteric an experience as might have been expected. The venue, which turned out to be little more than a stark community hall, was integral to the experience of the performance, as was watching the audience's response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play centres around a true set of events that happened in Kokstad in 1995, when 12 schoolboys were killed in a minibus accident. One of the survivors insists that he saw 50 naked women standing at the side of the road.  Whether or not this is attributed to the overactive imagination of a pubescent schoolboy is never the question as the village is plunged into a hysterical witch-hunt. Especially susceptible is the character of Xolani, who starts hearing voices calling to her from her grandmother's cupboard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rife with accessible symbolism and a flowing rapport with the audience, the storyline is uncomplicated enough for one to concentrate on the characters and their individual and communal emotional responses. Expect no logic or rationality in the themes, as this goes against the very nature of indigenous folklore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather appreciate the representation of the people's passion and belief, as this embodies the very human nature of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is this audience integration that fails a thoroughly engrossing chain of events. In Nyanga, the expectation of mass appreciation turned out to be short-lived, as onlookers felt free to join in the actors' dialogue and burst into uproarious fits of laughter at moments that hardly seemed to warrant it. (Witchcraft? What a crock!)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the players' credit, particularly the younger ones, they remained unrattled, delivering flowing performances worthy of the professional stage.  So the play becomes dependent on the seriousness of the audience, which may not really be a desirable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rural post-modernity of the story is effectively drawn by the set, and commendations to most of the cast - including the chickens - that took to crushing soda cans and snapping flies. The vocal casting is excellent, and on its own the music and singing would make a more than worthwhile show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it would be a shame for non-black audiences to see this play at a &quot; legitimate theatre venue&quot;. As a low-budget recreation hall presentation, the play is a success. Projects like this one lead the way in establishing the African theatre as accessible literature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An outcome to the question of how South Africa's existing symphony orchestras will relate to the imperatives of a multi- cultural democracy has been a long time in coming. Last week's announcement that the SABC will discontinue its funding of the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) as from April follows on the near-closure of the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra during 1996. It indicates that crunch time may finally have arrived for the country's orchestras as the debate that has generated years of conventions, think tanks, task groups and White Papers draws to a conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emerging consensus has increasingly indicated that additional public funding of the country's five permanent symphony orchestras will depend on a transformation of their perceived elitist role as custodians of Western high culture. The SABC's announcement has therefore come, if not as a surprise, as an irony to those who see the NSO's work over the past few years as one of the more progressive contributions in an area of cultural activity which is prone to conservative thinking.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from developing a strong audience base for its regular symphony concerts (doubling the number in recent years), the NSO has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to move beyond the rarefied atmosphere of the concert hall to bring its music to a broader section of the community. During 1996, a full 50% of the orchestra's 120 performances were non-orthodox concert presentations. Under the energetic leadership of music director Richard Cock, the standard NSO schedule has come to include an array of programmes bearing titles like Spring Light Classics, Musical Fireworks, Songs of Praise and the Last Night of the Proms at venues ranging from the Johannesburg Zoo to the Standard Bank Arena and Vista University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the orchestra's &quot;outdoor&quot; work goes beyond the kind of middle-class populism that is normally associated with &quot;Symphonic Pops&quot;-type programming.  The NSO's substantial engagement with African choral music, which Cock traces back to the 1970s, highlights an area of considerable, mutually enriching interaction that has been built up through the orchestra's involvement in projects like the Soweto nation-building initiative and the annual Soweto Messiah.This type of work can be seen as a precursor to Mzilikazi Khumalo's epic piece Ushaka, a work recorded by the orchestra during 1996, which invites emulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of projects like Rhythms of Africa in 1994, the NSO now counts among its guest performers luminaries like Abdullah Ibrahim, Rebecca Malope and Yvonne Chaka Chaka, and the orchestra's relationship with local diva Sibongile Khumalo goes back some time before her 'discovery' by mainstream audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is not to deny the importance of the NSO's work in what remains the primary focus of a symphony orchestra's activity, the classical repertoire. In this respect the orchestra has well served an appreciative, necessarily small segment of the country's population (attendance at live concerts is estimated at 250 000 people per year, with a radio and TV audience of &quot;some millions&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But under a new cultural dispensation, public funding of classical music must increasingly carry the tacit assent of the absent majority for whom the performers are silent. Music has no direct bearing on the imperatives of socio-economic upliftment; what role it can play is largely symbolic. Public response to the NSO's predicament has suggested that many South Africans feel that orchestras should be part of their civil environment. The challenge is to achieve this without such symbolic value merely denoting white privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is not aided by supporters of classical music who are prone to representing the classical canon as the only music of intrinsic worth to South Africa. The truth is that much indigenous music, both traditional and contemporary, shares the NSO's predicament - if it is that lucky. While the five permanent orchestral bodies fear for their continued existence, South Africa has no permanent national song and dance companies. Jazz, an area in which South African musicians have made true international impact remains largely dependent on the vicissitudes of a fickle market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If classical music is to take its place among these other substantial traditions, it will have to be for different reasons to those that enabled it to thrive in the past. Under the rubric of &quot;own affairs&quot; the country's major cultural institutions of the apartheid years, most of which housed orchestras, were created and sustained on an ideology of amorphous internationalism that can still be heard alongside more legitimate calls to &quot;save the orchestra&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is as yet far from clear what it would mean for orchestras to be a national asset to the new South Africa, as is the question of how to give substance to the notion of a national culture. What is evident is that, if classical music is to perform a meaningful role in the changing environment, it needs to shake off its image as a minority interest claiming a majority's portion of the cultural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Cock says that extending the NSO's activities into new areas is expensive, and until now has largely rested on extra funding. As the continued existence of the orchestra itself now appears to depend on such external sources, it stands to reason that the orchestra will have to curtail its initiatives in this field, even if it does manage to survive the withdrawal of the patronage of the SABC. About the orchestra's community programmes, Cock insists that these concerts are so important that we should keep them going at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hopes that the NSO's current crisis will serve as a catalyst in this process, rather than the disruption of some of the more significant moves that have in fact been made in this direction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE line between pop and classical music was redrawn last week with the unveiling of the first Classical Crossover Chart. Compilations dominate the new chart. Number one is Best Opera Album in the World ... Ever, followed by The Greatest Classical Movie Album, and The Number One Classical Album.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The listing was introduced by Chart Information Network after pressure from artists and record companies. The exclusion from the classical charts of Marianne Faithfull's collection of Kurt Weill songs last summer gave a fresh focus to demands for a chart for pop artists covering the classics and classical stars heading downmarket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catharine Pusey, chart director of Chart Information Network, said yesterday: &quot;Over the past five or so years it's been less and less easy to establish what is a classical record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The record companies, partly in response to the impact of Classic FM, have been putting out compilations and extracts from classical works and encouraging their artists to be more versatile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a classical chart that included everything from Wagner to compilations of your hundred favourite classics, and that didn't really make sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have now split the chart into two: a repertoire-driven classical chart and a crossover chart which deals with light classics and compilations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is possible to appear in both charts. When a classical superstar such as Lesley Garrett makes an operatic recording, it will be classified as classical, but her recent collection of Hollywood songs is deemed to be crossover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Who's who in the world of light music</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesley Garrett: Glamorous soprano and star of English National Opera whose collection Soprano in Hollywood is number 11 in crossover chart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryn Terfel: Burly Welsh baritone. Blessed with the popular touch - he appeared at the Proms in rugby kit, and has just recorded a selection of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawn Upshaw: American soprano who can also bash out Broadway standards with aplomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vanessa-Mae: Young violinist unashamedly marketed on sex appeal. Current record, The Classical Album I, appears in the classical chart, but expect her to become a fixture in nebulous world of crossover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigel Kennedy: Punk violinist who likes to dip into pop and jazz. No record for now, but crossover could almost have been invented for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jose Carreras: The short one of the Three Tenors, he has featured in the US crossover chart duetting with Natalie Cole on A Celebration of Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Williams: Classical guitarist who could claim to be original crossover artist through participation in late and unlamented supergroup Sky. In the new chart with film tunes collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elvis Costello: Pop artist who collaborates with Brodsky quartet. Bit of a prima donna and would be very cross to be called crossover.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the past a lot of us used to talk about the post- apartheid society, a society where - among other things - we would be able to tell our own stories. This would be the time when we would not have to be spoon-fed American garbage hour after hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, that time has arrived and a lot of us are realising that telling those stories is not as easy as glibly rolling that manifesto off our tongues.  Flat 27 on SABC1 is one such story that is proving difficult to tell on the telly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set in a flat, this a story that, on paper, is so delicious we salivated when it was sold to the press; we could not wait for it to hit the air waves.  The flatmates in Flat 27 have the potential of being the most entertaining people on television - a crazy mixture ranging from a returnee with a very British working class accent, to a township thug who seems to be constantly high on something artificial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this mixture there is a black intellectual type who goes by the name IQ.  This could be the setting for hilarious exchanges and sadly it does not work out this way. There is something missing. One sometimes sits and thinks, &quot;Did they think that that was funny?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the major problem with the series is that it is something slightly different from the genre that we are educated in, that is the American situation comedy. It doesn't have a laugh track that will tell lazy viewers: &quot; Laugh now ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is positive about Flat 27 is that it starts to try and tell the stories that we see so often around us but never see in our media. Like this week's episode titled South African American. Looking at the people whose entire lives are made-in-America- fantasies, the episode had the potential to be truly funny but missed it somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had contents of two South African Americans - straight from the townships of our rainbow land: &quot;Ice T, Ice Cube and Dr Dre... Who is Chicco?&quot; This was delivered in the appropriate &quot;you-go-gurl&quot; and-move-your- neck-in-a- funny-way accent. It could have been funny but it did not read, not that the actors were not good enough, They were, but they missed the delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series' big asset has got to be Themba Ndaba, who plays a township lout Chippa, who is somehow deposited in this bohemian commune. Many township residents will know Chippa quite well, with all his declarations ending with the question &quot;Or kanjani?&quot; (It loses so much in English, but means, approximately, &quot;Know what I am saying?&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most series this character gets sanitised to such an extent that no one knows what he is supposed to be apart from the producer or director. Not our Chippa; he is as raw and embarassing as they come. Flat 27 is a good idea, it could work very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe both the audience and the producers need to grow into it until they meet each other half way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flat 27 is on SABC1 at 6.30pm on Tuesdays</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The longest-running theatre project in South Africa, the Market Theatre Laboratory's Theatresports, staged weekly in Johannesburg, is being videotaped live and will be broadcast as a 13-part series on SABC3 from mid-1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a growing world trend since the late 1970s, the Market introduced the comedy concept in 1991 and it has continued to gain popularity, spreading to Grahamstown, Cape Town and Durban - and now across the nation via the public broadcaster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two teams of actors and the audience participate in Theatresports. Fed cues from the audience, the teams compete against one another to act out impromptu instructions and the most humorous and original team wins the round. The most original suggestions from the audience also win prizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a first for the SABC, shooting for the series began on Thursday this week under the direction of local comedy director Bobby Heaney and the co- ordination of actress Vanessa Cooke. One of the keys to the success of the Market's Theatresports is the standard of professional actors employed in the production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equivalent theatresport television projects abroad are the British Channel Four's Whose Line is it Anyway and ABC in America's Theatresports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A 67-year old protest poet intends suing the Minister of Safety and Security for the loss of a lithogram and a bundle of notes, confiscated from him by the police in a raid on his house in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Matthews, an award-winning poet and author who spent most of his life fighting apartheid, is dismayed at the manner in which the police have handled his requests for his lost belongings, both before and after the 1994 elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lithogram and the notes were confiscated along with a number of other items in January 1986 becuase they were said to contravene the Publications Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lithogram, titled Amilka, was a print of a montage of events representing the conflict in Mozambique. And he had hoped to write a novel from the lost travel notes, which documented a visit to Germany and exchanges with artists and anti-apartheid groups, including Swapo, the ANC and the PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthews's attempts to retrieve these items started six months after the raid, when he went to pick up his possessions at the Athlone police station.  While retrieving some items, these particular pieces had disappeared and requests for the police to find them have borne no fruit. The police are insisting that they do not have the items, and say they are prepared to fight the matter in court. Almost 10 years later, and after numerous lawyers letters, Matthews is no nearer his goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His claim will amount to comparatively little - approximately R6 000 - he says, but he is determined to press on to make a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthews's disillusionment is mixed into a deeper bitterness that black consciousness poets like himself do not receive greater acknowledgement from the post-apartheid government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IN its heyday, the South African musical Ipi Tombi generated some pretty diverse reactions. Those who regarded it as fabulous entertainment helped make it a box-office hit that was to see an initial five- year run, an international tour, several revivals and a conversion to film (which was, however, unsuccessful).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others chose to ignore it, dismissing its representation of black South Africans as insulting &quot;ethno-kitsch&quot; and its cast as &quot;moving curios&quot;, at best politically incorrect. The black consciousness movement and its anti- apartheid wings abroad declared it racist and proceeded to picket the production whenever it toured. They called it the worst kind of exploitation in a time that protest theatre practitioners had already begun their work under extreme pressure from the apartheid regime - the Gibson Kentes, the Maishe Maponyas and the Matsemela Manakas. And there were additional complications about the authenticity of the Ipi Tombi compositions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But through it all, its central tunes, like Mama Tembu's Wedding and The Warrior, melted into contemporary pop nostalgia and the original album is to this day a major seller - particularly among tourists. Yet the Eighties restaging at the Victory theatre in Johannesburg was picketed almost as vehemently as the original. So the big question is what a 1997 audience will make of Ipi Tombi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That question could well be answered in the coming months: a new version of the production is currently in rehearsal in Johannesburg under the direction of the grand old dame who wrote the original score in 1973, Bertha Egnos. She has retained the central songs and the themes of a warrior in love with a maiden; the clash between modern and traditional values. But she is working with the 60-strong cast, headed by every madam's Dingaan, Ken Gampu, and songstress Sophie Mgcina, to flesh out the originally thin storyline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no mean feat, as Egnos is now in her 85th year. In an interview this week, she filled in details of the proposed 1997 tour. Working with Anthony Chait of Fisher Hoffman Sithole as financial adviser and Gampu as director of the company - Ipi Tombi Productions - Egnos says that she is reviving the piece to &quot;satisfy a need in the market&quot;. Approached by Australian promoters, the tour is intended to kick off in South Africa in March or April before moving on to Perth, Melbourne and Sydney with South African Airways as one of the major sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is much like the original - also initially packed off to Perth. Egnos wrote the central songs when approached by Eartha Kitt's promoters in the early 1970s. Kitt was coming to play South Africa and wanted some African tunes. But she didn't take to the ones offered by Egnos and her daughter Gail.  Eventually, however, the songs were extended and collated into an LP. When Australia phoned asking for a play to accompany the music, the Egnoses complied and Ipi Tombi was born, following - some say too closely - the tradition of Leon Gluckman and Todd Matshikiza's King Kong (1958) and Welcome Msomi's Umabatha (1970).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King Kong was just deemed politically OK (Gluckman was, after all, a communist); Umabatha has finally been redeemed (in its day some also regarded the &quot;Zulu Macbeth&quot; as un-PC - of course that was before Msomi received the commission to stage the Mandela inauguration) and even Joan Brickhill's &quot; African&quot; musicals avoided the pickets - but Ipi Tombi's stigma lingered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egnos remains hurt by the charges of racism and exploitation. In her defence she refers to her body of work - some 14 musicals - and, in particular, the spirit of her first musical Dingaka (later filmed by Jamie Uys). She says that she loves Africa, that she feels the African rhythm in her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What she really wants to talk about is how wonderful her new, largely undiscovered, Ipi Tombi cast is to work with. In addition, Chait has come up with a groundbreaking financial empowerment scheme whereby cast members of the new Ipi Tombi will effectively earn a share of the show's takings. Taking in these developments and the changing political climate, it seems foolish to label Egnos and her production racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question remains whether the Nineties will smile on Ipi Tombi as a toe- tapping, nostalgic curiosity - or also be insulted by its unintentionally patronising depiction of Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HAZEL FRIEDMAN reports on a stormy debate raging in Grahamstown around the appointment of a foreigner as the new head of Rhodes University's fine arts department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The Department of Foreign Relations.&quot; That's what angry staff and students have dubbed the Fine Arts Department at Rhodes University. They are reacting to the controversial appointment of British artist and academic Mark Hayward above local applicants to head the Fine Arts Department. They accuse the review committee who chose Hayward of &quot;a lack of transparency and insight into the needs of South African art&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But committee members are in turn yelling, &quot;Sour grapes!&quot; They insist that Hayward was chosen simply because he was the best applicant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy began after the former head of the department, Professor Robert Brookes, went into early retirement at the end of 1996. In keeping with procedure, the faculty advertised the post and a review committee consisting of academics across the board and one independent member began shortlisting candidates. &quot;Our policy is to attract the best candidates,&quot; says Bruce Smith, the university's personnel director. Applicants appear before the committee to make a presentation, from which a shortlist is compiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff and students are supposed to give their own opinions, but lecturers claim that in this case they were not properly consulted on the final appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final list drawn up included Hilary Graham, a fine arts lecturer at Fort Hare University; Ian Calder from KwaZulu-Natal, Professor Estelle Marais from Unibo and Hayward, who is an artist, art historian and administrator working in Northern England. Former Director of Culture for Johannesburg, Christopher Till, applied for the position but did not make the shortlist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The versions of events that follow, as told by the staff and review committee, differ markedly from one another. Several staff members insist that the selection process lacked transparency because no one knew the exact number of applicants or whether anyone from Southern Africa had applied for the post. They also criticise the committee for including only one person with an art background - Melanie Hillebrand who runs a gallery in Port Elizabeth. Further, they insist that they are not acting out of a feeling of sour grapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In protest against the appointment artist Noel Hodnett, who has been with the department for 25 years and is head of drawing and painting, has resigned.  Hodnett did not apply for the position of department head and he has refused to comment on the controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a fellow lecturer, who preferred to remain anonymous, was less reticent.  &quot;We have nothing against overseas academics working in South Africa in general or Hayward in particular. But after Professor Brookes retired we embarked on a review of the department's curriculum, with the aim of transforming it in accordance with post- apartheid imperatives.&quot; He adds: &quot;No matter how qualified Hayward might be, he cannot possibly hope to grasp some the complexities facing art and art education at this moment in our history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the eight-person review committee says the staff and students should not be disgruntled as &quot;Hayward was the best candidate. He is a cutting edge artist, art historian and administrator with over 10 years' experience, and he complies with all the requirements. Basically the staff are perpetuating an outdated paradigm, according to which Rhodes graduates were always appointed to the position&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet none of the staff actually applied for the post of department head. In fact, they specifically asked for the position to be advertised both regionally and internationally in order, they say, to make the process as &quot; transparent and democratic as possible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the selection panel was not satisfied with the standard of the local applicants,&quot; said another equally embittered lecturer, &quot;they should have re- advertised and embarked on a policy of proactive headhunting. What they have done shows a total lack of understanding or concern for South African art.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - During the week, a crack appeared in a hitherto solid African economic edifice when Lesotho and Mozambique announced their withdrawal from the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a measure that shocked the 20-nation organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on this, Lusaka's Post newspaper said that the withdrawals tented &quot;to point, in a practical way, to the fact that not everyone sees clearly the organization's success even though it is supposed to be the most remarkable among organizations of its kind in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the withdrawals were sad, it added, they should not be &quot;an occasion for making questionable claims about the organization which tended to ridicule even the good work done so far.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, It said, &quot;COMESA should concentrate on establishing whether or not the reasons that have led to the withdrawal of Mozambique, Lesotho and possibly Namibia from the grouping are valid and what can be done to correct the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thrust, it went on, should be to keep the common market attractive to its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On political matters, a Lagos newspaper, Daily Champion, condemned the rebellion by soldiers in the Central African Republic demanding the payment of salaires and other entitlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that while their demands were legitimate, the way in which they tried to attain them was not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The method they adopted to press home their grievances has denied them whatever sympathy they should have earned,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Equally, their demand for the resignation of President (Ange-Felix) Patasse is very childish, because the armed forces of the country is only a tiny segment of the polity. They cannot, therefore, constitute themselves into a form of vanguard to administer a vote over who should govern the state, &quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our considered view that their action is condemnable, as it is unconstitional and illegal. It constitutes a danger to the overall good of the country,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar's newspapers owned newspapers commented on the arrest of Niger's three main opposition party leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politicians, who formed the country's coalition government before the coup in January 27, 1996, were put under house arrest following last week's demonstrations by eight opposition parties demanding access to the government media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The measure by the authorities in Niamey is symptomatic of democracy digging its own grave,&quot; Sud Quotidien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soleil cited some political anaylsted as having expressed fear that the government in Niamey would react to the demonstrations in an authoritanian manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, it said that while the election of Ibrahim Mainassara had raised much hope for political stability, after the country's year-long constitutional crisis, the introduction of a special tribunal to try the government's political foes was &quot;a major step backward&quot; for democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soleil also commented on the deal reached Wednesday between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the city of Hebron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had cross &quot;a psychological and even a political barrier&quot; by agreeing on the pullout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But more than political realism is needed for the movement initiated in the Middle-East, in general and between Israelis and Palestinians, to achieve real peace,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Saturday's goalless draw between the Zambian national soccer team and South Africa's &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot;, the African champions, has left a feeling of emptiness among soccer pundits in this soccer-crazy nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that dismal result in a bid for qualification for the 1998 World Cup in France, soccer fanatics in Lusaka have resorted to all sorts of scapegoating, witch-hunting and blaming everything and everybody, including God, for what they perceive to be an unbearable misfortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those being criticised for the team's poor showing is Mexico-based skipper, Kalusha Bwalya. Some fans have accused him of interference in the selection of the team, which they allege was not the best for such a crucial match.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fan in the northern town of Kasama, quoted by the Times of Zambia newspaper, raised eyebrows among the predominantly Christian Zambians, when he suggested that God was annoyed by the decision to stage the match on Saturday, which is considered by Jews as the Holy Sabbath. This, he claimed, breached God's own fourth commandment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An elder, Getron Sikazwe, of the Seventh Day Adventists Church, claimed that as a Christian nation Zambia should have refused to play on Saturday in accordance with the biblical edict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important to do everything according to the Bible if the nation is to effectively facilitate its Christian principles,&quot; Sikazwe was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the match, officials in President Frederick Chiluba's office had arranged a prayer session in the city to ask the God to bless the team so that it would beat the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outspoken Zambian daily newspaper, the Post, condemned the prayer session, claiming that it was intended to make political capital for Chiluba's government. The government's plan, it added, was tantamount to fooling God whom it said &quot;saw through&quot; the deception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba, a professed born again Christian, who in 1992 officially declared Zambia a Christian nation, had urged the church in the country to pray for the national soccer team, saying that victory could be assured with God's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba was in the stadium to see the team struggle to contain the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports reaching Lusaka from Johannesburg say that the South Africans had themselves consulted extensively with the country's renowned &quot;Sangomas&quot; (traditional medicinemen) to predict the result of the Lusaka game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the reports, the Sangomas refused to commit themselves, in an apparent fear of the wrath of Zambian Gods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two teams are scheduled for the return match in Johannesburg later in the year. It is anybody's guess whether God will &quot;smile on&quot; Zambia in that clash.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (PANA) - Nigerian soccer star Nwankwo Kanu has left Cleveland, where he underwent surgery to repair a defective valve in his heart in November, for California to begin the second stage of his rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first stage was carried out in Cleveland, after he was discharged from the hospital on Dec. 4, 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in California, Kanu will use sophisticated equipment to regain full use of his limbs as well as his strength and do some jogging and swimming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors say they expect Kanu, who had signed for Italy's Inter Milan, to recover fully and return to the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Kanu, who captained Nigeria's gold medal winning Olympic team in August 1996, has finally received the 50,000 U.S. dollars pledged to him by the Nigerian government to meet part of his medical bills, expected to reach about 100,000 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money was delivered to him Wednesday by the chairman of the Nigeria Football Association, Abdulmumini Aminu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu told the Pan African News Agency in New York that the decision to physically bring the money to Kanu was an indication of the government's concern for the player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu said that the government might be willing to offer more help to the 20-year-old player.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopia said Friday its military had played no role in the successful rebel attacks on government troops in Sudan's Blue Nile Province this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest accusation levelled against Ethiopia was patently aimed at seeking an alibi for a military setback visited upon by the Sudan People's Liberation Army and its allies,&quot; said Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments were contained in a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan complained to the council Sunday that Ethiopian forces had supported the anti-government troops n their capture of two borders towns. Ethiopia called the accusation an &quot;outrageous and baseless claim&quot; and &quot;completely out of character&quot; with the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another public statement, Seyoum said Ethiopia had handled with wisdom and patience, what he described as &quot;various blatant provocations&quot; against the country by the Sudanese authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among these, he cited the abortive attempt to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during his visit for an Africa summit in Addis Ababa, in June 1995.  Seyoum also gave as an example of what he termed was Sudan's &quot;state sponsored terrorism&quot;, Khartoum's call for holy war, or jihad, against Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there were rogue states in the world, there was little doubt that the government in Khartoum would top the list,&quot; Seyoum said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Sudanese government should not be allowed to continue to externalize its domestic crisis and in the process defame its neighbors, such as Ethiopia, &quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, he said, had no option but to remain vigilant in exercising the right of self-defence &quot;against a regime which the Security Council knew had become a menace to the peace and stability of the whole region.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - At least 500 people die of AIDS-related illnesses every week in Zimbabwe, an official of the country's AIDS control agency has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evaristo Marowa, the co-ordinator of the National AIDS Control Programme, said Zimbabwe's cumulative AIDS cases soared, at least, to 200,000 by the end of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an estimated 1.2 million Zimbabweans now living with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, Marowa said the agency would mobilize all available resources, social and political, to curb the pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1997 focus will be on strong sustainable political mobilization so that a substantive supporting environment is provided for AIDS prevention and control,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the country's news agency, ZIANA, that AIDS continued to be a cause of concern, owing to the large number of people already with HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marowa said that 1996 had ended on a &quot;note of hope&quot; with pronouncements by President Robert Mugabe being indicative of growing political commitment to the fight against AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an address to the nation in December 1996, Mugabe said government would soon gazette a National Code of Practice on AIDS and Employment, which would prohibit discrimination against HIV/AIDS-infected workers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The frenzy that has characterized Zimbabwe's stock market over the past few months could end sooner than expected as second rate and blue chip stocks enter a spell of self-correction, analysts said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They told the country's news agency, ZIANA, that although financial counters were expected to continue hitting headlines, others were expected to face market resistance as investors start taking profits, forcing the key market indicator, the Industrial Index, on a downward spiral.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Indications of a slowdown are beginning to creep into the market particularly in second rate stocks, and Tedco and Truworths would come to mind,&quot; one analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stock market surprised many economists in 1996 when from just over 4, 000 points at the beginning of the year, it soared 121 percent to end the year at an all-time high of 8,786.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trend continued into the new year with solid performance from financial counters, being led by First Merchant Bank and Barclays Bank where the latter gained over 900 cents, or nine zimdollars (0.9 U.S. dollars) in just two days this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no doubt that financials will have a good year in 1997 as a result of prospects of a good agricultural season and good economic performance.&quot; the analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, industriales were active but mixed on Friday, with the key Industrial Index losing 30 points to close at 10,291.51 points. The mining index sheded nearly three points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian government has terminated its multibillion-dollar contract with the Russian firm, TPE, for the construction of a steel complex at Ajaokuta, in the center of the country, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1983 completion date of the five-billion-dollar contract conceived in the 1960s to launch Nigeria into industrial age has not been met because of operational hitches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, several units of the complex have been completed for the production of rods and other steel and foundry products in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAN said that work at the main gigantic project site had reached 98 percent completion before the termination of the contract with TPE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm had already been paid some 50 billion naira (about 625 million U.S.  dollars) for the work done but some bills are outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inadequate working capital and shortage of raw materials were said to be delaying the remaining part of the construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency quoted the Russians as saying they could only resume work if a rail line was completed to ease the transportation of raw materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of Nigeria's Federal Power and Steel Ministry, supervising the project, said there had been consultations between the Nigerian and Russian officials on how to settle the outstanding debts owed the Russian contractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, some 8,000 Nigerian junior employees of the firm, launched a violent strike, demanding the payment of their salaries. This caused substantial damage to property at the steel complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The riot led to a mass sacking of the strikers and re-organization of the management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Briton, John Nolan, 48, received the stiffest sentence of 10 years for exporting 22.9 kilograms of Indian hemp from the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, on Sept. 5, 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal heard that his Nigerian accomplice, Akinbo Ohuona, 32, was arrested on the same flight with 10 kilograms of the substance. He received seven years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third convict was Ugonna Anya, 32. She was sentenced to five years in prison for offering to sell 28.4 grams of heroin on Oct. 10, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Abdullahi Tijani, the tribunal's chairman, ordered Sunday Olukayode, who is now in a Nigerian prison, to stay there for another two and a half years. He was deported from Finland in November 1995, after serving a two- year jail sentence for drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has strict anti-drug trafficking laws, which prescribe double trial of its citizens already convicted for drug offences in foreign lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the country's Federal Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Maj. Gen.  Musa Bamaiyi, is advocating the reintroduction of the death penalty for convicted drug offenders in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this would deter potential offenders in the trade, which had earned Nigeria a poor international image.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latest Abuja II Accord signed by Liberia's warring factions in August this year provides a guideline for disarmament to begin on November 22 and conclude on January 31, 1996. The process commenced with jubilation and November 22nd was declared a Disarmament Holiday in Liberia. After about 11 days, it was reported that about 2,258 of the questionable 60,000 combatants have turned in their weapons. It is gradually losing momentum (and) a number of events and accusations among factional leaders have contributed to this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a. On November 27, fighting was reported to continue in the Southeast around Grand Gedeh County between the Liberia Peace Council (LPC) and the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). ECOMOG moved into Tappita to create a buffer zone. The NPFL agreed to withdraw from the town of Tuzon to Toe Town to enable ECOMOG's deployment. It is not clear which group provoked the fighting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b. On November 22 at about 4:00 P.M. fighting erupted between ULIMO-J and ULIMO-K in Bomi County. Several civilians were killed about 20 houses burnt in Borbor Town; 2 ULIMO-J fighters (Thomas and Kpor) were abducted along with several civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c. There have been constant accusations made by the NPFL against the LPC and AFL. The (NPFL) claims that there are plans by both groups to eliminate their leader. Both groups are accusing the NPFL of hatching new plans to attack their positions and interrupt the schedule of disarmament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d. The government as a collective has not made concrete efforts to contribute financially toward incentives to the combatants. In the face of this, widespread corruption has been institutionalized with reports of cash deposits in homes of ministers, purchase of 60 new vehicles and other acts of economic pillage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e. The International community needs to re-assess its strategies regarding incentives for ex- combatants . Factional loyalists intend to use the issue of incentives to becloud the objectives of disarmament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OTHERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a A new ECOWAS Envoy has bee appointed. He is Alhaji Tefewa Belewa of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b. A military delegation arrived on the 27th of November (from) Niger. It is expected that this was an assessment visit intended to create the basis for the commitment of troops to ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Press, Seven years now, we have witnessed and continue to witness an unceasing trend of human rights violations, massive destruction of properties, unchecked corruption and mismanagement of public offices, unrestrained torture, rape, mayhem, massacre, etc. These acts of inhumane, cruel and degrading treatments are meted out by men who have arrogated to themselves a false monopoly over gangsterism and violence as a means of access to power and wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past years, human rights organizations have emerged with the aim of striving to re-establish and re-orientate respect of (the) rule of law, advocate, educate and sensitize the Liberian people to their basic human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous evidence abound regarding the woeful experience of our devastated nation. The war commenced on December 24, 1989. Since then, we have experienced killings in all parts of the country. We have been haunted by an unending nightmare of massacres and destruction. Inspite of attempts by unarmed civilians to address the spectre of violence, the carnage continues with its attending toll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, today we call you here in further pursuit of our commitment to sensitize and attempt to seek redress for individuals who have become constant victims of our civil strife. We do this not to supplant Government, neither to antagonize the powers that be, as others have referred to it, but to assist in creating the atmospherefor the inviolability of the human person. We also do not see ourselves as legally assuming the functions of Government in ensuring that the rights of citizens are guaranteed at all time; our mission is a moral pressure on the conscience of government, holding it to the dictates of the constitution and international laws. We also do so in the face of what appears to be a glaring abdication by government regarding its obligation to the citizens of Liberia as enshrined int he Liberian Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the inception of agreements on the Liberian conflict we have seen the gradual erosion of civilians authority with the concomitant legitimization and institutionalization of acts of banditry and violence through the outright pawning of leadership of factions as a guarantee for disarmament and peace. We have in the past and today, continue to argue about the farcical nature of this conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events of April 6, 1996 however, convinced both the local and international community to adopt constraints/measures to minimize the excesses of factions. The recent Abuja Accord vindicate this view in its attempts to identify specific sanctions against violators. We believe &quot;law is nothing without the apparatus capapble of ensuring compliance or enforcement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspite of these measures, the violations continue. What we attempt to do here is to allow local pressure to attract the conscience of the international community to insist on the application and enforcement of sanctions as mandated by the recent Abuja Accord of August (1996).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that this Accord and its enforceability constitutes a major challenge to the local and international community and is a litmus test to the extent that our nightmares can be terminated. In the midst of inadequate logistics and the intentional, well orchestrated attack on our offices, we have all been left bare to operate on minimal facilities. Yet, we are commited to highlight and investigate some of the recent violations as evident that Liberians are concern about their plight and hence deserve attention. We call you here, first. to establish that the human rights record of this year is very disheartening. Events of April 6, 1996, characterized by the &quot;Government forces&quot; attack on citizens, followed by the univestigated murder of Hon. Seh Vincent, the two marketeers, two young ladies: Chrisitiana and Josephine among others represent the depth of insensitivity that have characterized our justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, to look deeply into the Sinje Massacre which occured in September 1996. The Bloun Town Massacre of December 7, 1996, the abduction case involving employees of the Ministry of Education and a position regarding the shadow Congo Defense Force (CDF) operating in the western part of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. THE SINJE MASSACRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 28, 1996, Liberians and the world were once more awakened to the brutality that have characterized our senseless civil war. Like the Carter Camp and Du Port Road massacres, spineless individuals, under the cover of darkness, attacked unarmed civilians in Sinje, Grand Cape Mount County. Outcries for conclusive investigation persist. Given our commitment, we commenced investigation into the massacre, undertook series of visits to the area and interviewed survivors. We are here to report to you our findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detailed report is available but we will provide you a summary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUMMARY OF THE SINJE MASSACRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senji Massacre occured on September 28, 1996 in Grand Cape Mount County barely a month following the signing of the recent Abuja Agreement. On September 27, 1996, a day before the massacre, the World Food Program (WFP), through its implementing partner in the region, the Liberia Islamic Union for Reconstruction and Development (LIURD) distributed Bulgur Whear and other food items to residents of Sinje. On September 28, 1996, at about 5:30 A.M.  residents of Sinje were awakened by a volley of gunfire. Some ran from their homes while others were killed by the attackers. According to our investigations about 21 persons were killed in the massacre while about 21 others were abducted, some with their families.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bloun Town Massacre:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 7, 1996, about 11 persons were bestially massacred in Bloun Town allegedly by ULIMO-J fighters while they went in pursuit of food. Bloun Town is across the Po River from Zwannah Town, a displaced and refugee center about 21 miles outside Monrovia and 6 miles from Hotel Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrified by the news of the massacre, a team of 4 human rights investigators proceeded to the area on Friday, December 13, 1996, to investigate the massacre. Having interviewed an array of survivors, relatives and witnesses, which included the displaced refugees, relief workers in the camp and ECOMOG, in Zwannah Town, Bloun Town and Monrovia, the following conclusions, recommendations and observations were reached:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It was observed that fighting has been going on in the area beyond Zwannah Town over the past two months between the Congo Defense Force (CDF) and ULlMO-J in complete violation of the ceasefire agreement;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is observed that terror has haunted the various villages and towns around the Po River over the past six months;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It Was also observed that more civilians were reportedly tortured and/or killed in the last few weeks but because of the degree of terror across the Po River, civilians cannot determine the number of individuals killed or tortured. This suggest that the actual number of persons killed are more than eight;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There are constant threats of attack on the town by ULIMO-J because of the constant presence of the Congo Defense Force (CDF) in the area. The Congo Defense Force (CDF) carries out trade within the area with civilians and ECOMOG without being stopped. It was also observed that no degree of disarmament is presently being enforced in the vicinity as the Congo Defense Force appears to be a shady military arrangement. There is no disarmament for them. Concern is also being raised about the presence of ULIMO-J's Former Chief of Staff (D. Armah Youlo) in the area. Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That ECOMOG take steps to inhibit the regular presence of known fighters in the displaced center (Zwannah Town);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That civilians must minimize the level of trade with the fighters. The trade has continued to encourage the looting and harassment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The civilians have linked the issue of food distribution and security; they have therefore requested that food distribution be preceded by thorough security investigation of their environs; 4. The leadership of the camp needs to be encouraged to conduct a thorough research on the issue o security, freedom of movement, acts of torture and murder in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCLUSION:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That the general security situation is highly unfavorable. What is today referred to as the Congo Defense Force (CDF) said to be operating in the area is being commanded by on Wilmot Charles, His advisor is his father Ezekiel Charles; Both men are alleged to be former members of the Armed Forces of Liberia. 2. It is clear from the preponderance of testimonies that the act was committed by ULIMO-J fighters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The final lit of those killed (victims) was as follows: 1. Boima Cole. 2.  Bala Cole. 3. Foray Cole aka Gboyo. 4. Jebbeh Cole. 5. Miatta Goba. 6, Charles Massaley. 7, Gbessay Gobah. 8. Jatou Armah. 9. Bendu Ngongho. 10.  Zennie Sheriff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the alleged perpetrators:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Cape Mount Trouble. 2. Bush Devil. 4. It was reported that all of those killed were mutilated except for one person who was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RECENT ABDUCTION CASE INVOLVING EMPLOYEES OF THE EDUCATION MINISTRY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 13, 1996, Minister Moses Barh of the Education Ministry informed us that some citizens were allegedly abducted from his vehicle on December 1, 1996 while returning from Paynesville. He named the victims as: (1) Mr. Charles B. Davis - Special Assistant to the Minister, (2) Mr. James B.  Kerkulah Driver (3) Miss Julia Kuoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His letter also alleged that the incident occurred in Congo Town. Further investigations and interviews alleged that the incident occurred around the Zone 3 Police Station in Congo Town 10 yards from the home of Councilman Charles Taylor. The three abductees were taken from the vehicle mercilessly flogged and taken to the Watanga Base. The alleged Perpetrators mentioned in the National Newspaper of December 13, 1996 were listed as follows: l. Col, Chris Rogers. 2. Gen. Two for Five. 3. Gen. Banana. 4. Gen, Sebastain Boys</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also alleged that the incident, occurred in the presence of Former Councilman Isaac Saye Musa. What is significant about this incident is that since such public accusation was made against the above listed individuals, almost two weeks now, no pubic rebuttal has been made neither has any legal avenue pursued to vindicate themselves. We think this incident attests to the growing acts of abduction and hostage-taking in our safe havens. We call on the Justice Ministry to act with a sense of urgency and restore the respect for law and order as we continue to live in the chains of constant fear, lawlessness and banditry. Finally, we call on the Justice Ministry and ECOMOG and the NPFL leadership to take steps to demolish the notorious WANTANGA BASE which has allegedly become a torture enclave or the point of no return for many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONGO DEFENSE FORCE (CDF)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Human Rights Community (L.H.R.C.) is concerned about the emergence and constant mention of a group called the Congo Defense Force around the Po River, a disturbing phenomenon in the Liberian Peace Process.  We are especially concern that some acts of bestiality and criminality have been associated with their presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we do not want to grant credence to such on illegal and mischievous organization. It is imperative to draw attention to their existence as their involvement in the Liberian situation has accentuated the suffering and destruction of the Liberian people and their properties. They have been reportedly linked to the ambush of December 14, 1996 which occurred on the Bomi Highway in which 4 persons were killed. Since its emergence earlier this year, the so-called Congo Defense Force (CDF), this shadow group has undertaken a pattern of Human Rights abuses and ceasefire violations in the western region. This presents a disturbing feature both for the already horrible Human Rights situation and painstaking peace process. Our information, as received from interviewees in the western region as well as those connected to the Congo Defense Force (CDF) is that this group has affiliation or is in fact an offshoot of one or two of the factions. Our interaction with some elements of the Congo Defense Force (CDF) revealed that they refer to a leader of one of the recognized factions as (ULIMO-K) leader and to the NPFL as one of their suppliers of arms and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this group (may) not be strong enough to reverse or impact the chemistry of the Peace Process there is a likelihood and fear that some recognized faction, fearing dissolution, wanting to undermine or abdicate responsibility under the Abuja Accord and continue their military campaign could transform themselves into splinter groups of this nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a group not recognized by the Abuja Peace Agreement, the actions of this so-called Congo Defense Force (CDF) are criminal in nature and must therefore not be condoned. Wrong precedence and impunity, we have repeatedly warned, are detrimental to the attainment of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We therefore advise that ECOMOG, UNOMIL, LNTG and other groups must adopt a homogenous policy regarding dealings and interaction with the CDF. It is important to attribute criminal responsibility for violations and atrocities committed by this group. We would however advise against granting them undue legitimacy and formal recognition. MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, our position will be officially communicated to all concerned and ensure that the relevant pressure will be brought to bear. Another point of concern is the limited jurisdiction of our Justice System. ln a special Government announcement of December 3, 1996, the Justice Minister alluded to this fact in her advise to investors and/or their representatives not to proceed to any area of the country not yet declared &quot;Safe Haven(s)&quot; and where the presence of the Government of Liberia has not been reestablished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are concerned that inspite of the representation on the Council of State of all faction leaders, the country remains balkanized into mini spheres of control where the standards of justice are dictated by factions and not by the government of Liberia; where factions and their operatives are not answerable to the jurisdiction of our national justice system. We call on the LNTG to take steps in addressing the growing concern which continues to inhibit freedom of movement and subject our people to inhumane and degrading treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - With a 23 percent increase in births to teenagers predicted in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 and HIV/AIDS increasing rapidly among youth, health experts stress there is an urgent need to provide adolescents with access to reproductive health services. To this end, more than 350 policymakers, health care providers, researchers, young people, and others from throughout Africa will meet in Addis Ababa January 20-24 for the African Forum on Adolescent Reproductive Health, at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Forum, which is sponsored by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Africa Division, and coordinated by The Centre for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA), will adopt guidelines for policies and services to improve adolescent reproductive health. UNFPA is a world leader in promoting reproductive health and family planning and the largest multilateral funder of population and development programs. CEDPA, an international non- governmental organization that works to improve the status of women and youth, supports reproductive health programs in Africa and Asia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, and unsafe abortion are having devastating effects on the health and economic prospects of youth as well as on development expectations for the region.  More than 50 percent of young women in the region give birth before the age of 20, and in some countries as many as 40 percent have had their first child by age 18. Early pregnancy is life-threatening. Young women ages 15-19 are twice as likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth as older women; their infants also are more likely to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the world, and the average age of infection and onset of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa is younger than the global average. Women become infected about 4 years earlier than men -- 30 percent of female AIDS cases are in women under 25, and infection rates are high among pregnant young women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High adolescent fertility is a major factor in continuing rapid population growth, widely acknowledged as a major problem in the region. Women who begin having children at an early age have more children than those who start in their twenties and thirties and often have fewer wage-earning opportunities, contributing to both accelerating population growth and poverty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Notes from the Net</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading all the FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) highlighted in last week's column, you must be salivating at the idea of putting up a web page of your own. Problem is, you probably don't want to pay for the pleasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is, you don't have to. If you already have an Internet service provider (ISP), you probably already have free space that you're not using: most ISPs offer between 500kb and 1Mb free space on their system for their subscribers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from that option, numerous sites on the web offer free hosting of web pages, as long as they are personal or non-profit type pages. Many of these services even include automatic page-creation systems, where you merely type the relevant information into the relevant spaces, and something like a web design robot puts it into web page format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main drawback of this auto-design system is that you get a fairly dull- looking page, with little option for spicing it up yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if that suits your needs for the moment, you could start with Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com/), where a request in their search box for Free Web Pages will throw up a handsome crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many free services give you both the create-a-page option and do-it- yourself. The best of these is GeoCities (http://www.geocities.com/), which has created hundreds of &quot;residential neighbourhoods&quot; divided into 29 &quot;themed communities&quot;. Each neighbourhood is capable of hosting hundreds of personal home pages. The neighbourhoods take the name of a city, representing the specific theme followed by its &quot;inhabitants&quot;. For instance, Athens is a community based on education, teaching, reading, writing and philosophy; Colosseum caters for sports fans, and Enchanted Forest for kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hong Kong Cybercity (http://www.cybercity.hko.net/) is a similar concept, offering free space in a trio of themed neighbourhoods, namely Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo. It is one of the more generous of these services, providing 5mb of space. However, it is on a very slow link to this side of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelfire Communications (http://www.angelfire.com/) also offers free home pages but, like many of these services, imposes a number of restrictions.  These include the obvious, like bars on pornography and illegal commercial activities, and the less obvious, like paid advertising from an outside source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">123 Go Global (http://www.10mb.com/) offers free sites for commercial web designers and resellers to start or expand their web business, obviously on the basis that they would bring paying customers to the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many sites offering free space eventually find themselves overwhelmed by demand, and curtail the service. If you intend building up your page over many years, it might be wise to stick to your own Internet service provider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a more extensive list of free web services, visit the online version of this column at http://www.mg.co.za/mg/pc/pcrevie1.htm</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - James Lamont tells Jacquie Golding-Duffy that fellow editors cannot afford not to take him seriously, despite his age</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is young and overly cautious, say some. Others argue that his track record is unimpressive and does not qualify him to sit at the helm of Business Report. But 28- year-old James Lamont, the newly appointed editor of The Star's business section, says South African journalism has always been his goal, and his career path has consisted of stepping stones towards that goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamont is the product of a private school - Winchester College, Britain, followed by the University of York, with a post- graduate degree in Southern African studies in 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His curriculum vitae includes a stint on the Middle East Times in Cairo, which, he admits, was &quot;not a large publication&quot;, boasting a staff of not more than 15. He has also worked as a stringer for Opec news agency and a retail/consumer magazine, Link, in the south of England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His list of achievements in the UK also include working for the Labour Party: &quot;I was the election press officer for a small constituency,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did he not serve on a British national newspaper before leaving? &quot;I just never applied. My career is taking a logical path. I have had a sustained interest in Africa and South Africa and that is why I am here. The Middle East Times was a stepping stone to get where I am today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a young age I left Britain to come to Africa and worked in Namibia as an economics teacher for a non-governmental organisation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamont's first job on arrival in South Africa in 1995 was business editor at Finance Week, followed by a move to Business Report where he was industrial editor. He served a term of one year before his promotion. He sits in the stark office occupied until recently by his predecessor, Peter Bruce, now Financial Mail editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cannot help but compare Lamont to his predecessors: Bruce, a respected financial journalist and former home desk editor at the Financial Times, and Jim Smith, Business Report's first editor, a highly acclaimed journalist, writer and foreign correspondent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamont is believed to be Bruce's appointment, an ironic scenario involving a rival editor exerting influence among the big boys at the Independent Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With six years' experience in journalism, Lamont says he hopes his colleagues will judge him on merit rather than prejudge him because of his age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite his projected confidence, he cannot help constantly referring to Bruce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Peter always says, this newspaper has a robust financial team which will keep it at the forefront of business news,&quot; states Lamont, adding that although journalists on the team are young, they certainly are not novices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamont says his age should not be seen as a handicap but an asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not unusual in Britain to appoint young editors and this newspaper is young and vibrant which makes it appropriate that they should have chosen me,&quot; he says, hand on hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The appointment of young editors is a trend which is likely to take off in South Africa alongside the shake-up of business titles and the constant change of owners. Business Report has been marketing itself as an innovative publication and the group needed someone at the helm who reflects that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he regards his editorship as a &quot;challenge&quot;, adding that Bruce has &quot; taught me a lot&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of fellow editors' attitude towards him, Lamont says: &quot;Editors at rival publications cannot afford not to take me seriously. The fact that I have been appointed as editor makes it clear that Independent's management takes me seriously. My job is to take this publication into the next era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamont will be in charge of 48 staffers and does not seem intimidated by the task at hand. But some seasoned editors say he should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the business journal is believed to have played a role in upgrading the Independent Group's carrier newspapers in Gauteng and other regions, Lamont is faced with the challenge of ensuring that its position is consolidated and that it does not buckle from the competition of Times Media Limited's rival Business Day, recently taken aboard by the Pearsons group and its daily, the London Financial Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some veteran editors argue that Lamont should have been allowed the time to nurture the &quot;instinct&quot; and &quot;good judgement&quot; that come with several years in the profession. However, as one editor pointed out: &quot;William Pitt (the younger) was made prime minister of Britain at the young age of 21&quot; - although another countered that Pitt was a product of the 18th century, not the 20th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some tension brewing at Independent Newspapers with former colleagues of Lamont alleging it is inappropriate that a foreigner be chosen to head Business Report when the group has been punting its fast-tracking course for black and female journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Lamont argues that he is not a foreigner. With a South African mother and a grandfather who was an industrialist from Vereeniging, Lamont is confident that he qualifies for the position: &quot;I would like to stress that I am half South African.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should critics want to argue that he was not born and bred locally, Lamont challenges them, arguing that a fresh eye will serve the publication well since locals are not as observant, often seeing events through tired eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He contends that should a foreigner have been brought in (the group's deputy chief executive, Ivan Fallon, flew to London to scout for new talent) then &quot;the newsroom would have had to gear itself towards being accustomed to an outsider. Instead I know them and they know me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamont's permanent residency is not in order but he is applying for citizenship. He says he hopes to enjoy dual citizenship and that the matter should be wrapped up by month-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Business Report's deputy, for the moment, remains John Spira,&quot; says Lamont.  Spira has twice been overlooked for the editorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the affirmative action front, Lamont says one in five journalists are black and he wants to improve that quota. &quot;I want to encourage more black reporters to join the group. More black juniors need to be recruited and within two years they must be trained to be accomplished and respected names in the industry,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng Newspapers managing director Deon du Plessis says Lamont has his eye firmly fixed on the 21st century and is a confident chap. &quot;Besides that, our appointment has broken the mould that only long-serving members will get the post of editor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of fast-tracking and the lack of black and female editors, Du Plessis argued that the fast-tracking course at Harvard University last year was to encourage reporters to be &quot;active&quot; within the stable. &quot;It was not a guarantee towards an editorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Highveld Stereo's new managers are grappling with change, reports Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Highveld Stereo managing director Eon de Vos has left the radio station after an association of 17 years. De Vos and some of the new owners of Highveld differed on the strategy that should be used to take Highveld into the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions began brewing between the old and the new when Highveld's staffers moved offices in December and took up space at the Primedia Broadcasting location in Rivonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can put their finger on the problem but there existed differences of opinion between the new guard and the old-timers from the moment the sale was completed, says one Highveld DJ who refused to be named. The tensions varied from differences in attitude to change in the command structure with the new guard taking over the reins and transforming the newsroom by encouraging the influx of affirmative action cadets who are being trained as radio reporters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highveld was sold last year at a cost of R320-million to the Africa on Air consortium, consisting of Primedia Broadcasting, the Mineworkers Investment Company, the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union and the Women's Investment Portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Vos this week told the Mail &amp; Guardian that he agrees with the new owners that the main goal of commercial radio is to make money and offer advertisers a platform to market their wares. However, he argues that there existed differences between himself and management on the development of an on- air format and the manner in which the merging of cultures was taking place at Highveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleagues close to De Vos say that he was not fired nor did he resign, but there was an agreement that he and Primedia Broadcasting chief executive Stan Katz should part ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was amicable but I think De Vos reached the stage where he had to ask himself whether fighting out the differences with Katz was worth all the effort,&quot; said one colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that it was not a quick decision and was mulled over by the people concerned for some months. De Vos's association with Highveld began as a DJ in 1979, followed by a management and public relations role in 1983 and 1984. He then went back on air in 1986 and has since been associated with Highveld in various ways, his last position being managing director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a couple of things that I am looking into but it is too early to reveal any of my plans,&quot; said De Vos, nearly a week after his departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katz confirmed that there were differences between himself and De Vos but said this did not stem from any plans to transform Highveld. The parting, he said, was amicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primedia Broadcasting has a 40% stake in Highveld. The group also holds the management contract for Highveld which effectively puts Katz in charge of the day- to-day running of the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside Katz is Highveld Stereo's non- executive chair, Kuben Pillay.  Katz, Pillay and a third party form a management committee which is responsible for the long-term plans of the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day-to-day running of Highveld, Katz cannot help but spew forth the station's progress as he sees it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a great deal of transformation taking place but we are not planning to change the music station's basic format. We are targeting a 25+ audience and are playing more mainstream adult contemporary music with a strong mix of familiar songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Highveld Stereo used to play a lot of unfamiliar songs and we believe that people enjoy that which is familiar to them. We are conducting extensive research into what our target audience wants to listen to. Meanwhile, we assume that listeners do not like the unfamiliar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katz argues that Highveld's former managers had not conducted research for many years, thus forcing the station's new management to reassess its target audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highveld, he says, is involved in an ongoing process of hiring people and has &quot;a fully fledged news team&quot; of 11 reporters. He admits there will be competition for Primedia's other radio station - Gauteng- based Radio 702 - but believes the roles of the two radio stations differ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa on Air's Pillay agrees. He says Radio 702 and Highveld Stereo will compete for audiences and adspend which is healthy. However, he adds that the former is information and news-driven, which is typical of talk radio; while the latter is music-based, typical of commercial radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two news teams operate independently of each other and are targeting different listeners,&quot; says Pillay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have listened to Highveld Stereo will have noticed a &quot;tweeking of the format&quot; - it has been tightened with more golden oldies being played and there is aggressive marketing taking place on air (such as the punting of Highveld's place on the dial, 94,7FM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Katz talks of the great deal of &quot;optimism and enthusiasm&quot; in the Highveld newsroom, Pillay tells of the promise of performance made to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). Africa on Air vowed to use this investment opportunity to advance previously disadvantaged groups and concentrate on training potential reporters at Primedia's state-of-the-art facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On affirmative action, certain sources in the consortium argue that some of the veteran staffers at Highveld are not keen to see their positions usurped by upcoming young black talent, while others say this projected paranoia is a misconception and that things at Highveld are &quot;simply hunkydory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is believed that Africa on Air was forced to give the IBA and SABC an undertaking that it would not fire people at random on taking control of the radio station. Instead, Highveld's new management has to ensure that transferred staffers keep their jobs for at least one year, a promise which has, in some instances, proven to be a stumbling block towards progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pillay refused to be drawn on the Katz/De Vos saga, saying simply that the latter decided to leave Highveld's employ last Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear why the two men clashed, but as well-known Radio 702 DJ Chris Gibbons says: &quot;As with most mergers and new acquisitions, there is almost invariably a clash at the top, resulting in one of the big boys spending more time with the family.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons, who is also managing director of Broadcast Resources at Primedia Broadcasting, says the company has made a &quot;number of stabs&quot; at affirmative action but these have been &quot;without conspicuous success&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Primedia is now &quot;going over the ground again&quot;, and has resorted to using a consultant and forming a policy committee which hopes to successfully tackle the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workshops and consultation are the keys words being bandied about the corridors of Primedia with management feeling the pressure to succeed on the affirmative action front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel we have a complexion which is pretty male and pretty white and there is a feeling that we have to access a diverse market. There has now been a management drive towards bringing staffers into the equation and hopefully we will get it (affirmative action) right this time round,&quot; says Gibbons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the composition of Primedia Broadcasting in terms of affirmative action is 70% white to 30% black. &quot;At Primedia we have one person of colour on the main board, but several affirmative action candidates hold senior positions throughout the company. Let us not forget that affirmative action is not only based on colour but is a question of gender as well and Primedia has several women in key positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons says Primedia has been around in one shape or another for more than 16 years. In 1980 its radio station was launched with a mixed race format - something which in the new South Africa would be dead right - but a year later, a decision had to be taken to &quot;either go black or white&quot;. Radio 702 went the white route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, at the time, the deliberate crossover of cultures and an intentionally mixed format bombed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gibbons admits that Primedia is probably not moving at a fast enough pace for the new South Africa, but he says the company is probably faring better than most with affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All eyes are on the Primedia group, especially with its latest and expensive acquisition - Highveld - officially forming part of the stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa on Air and Primedia take &quot;complete control&quot; of Highveld Stereo in March - which means they will start selling their own advertisements.  Currently, the adspend of the radio station is being placed by the SABC, with Highveld's sales team impatiently waiting in the wings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The task group on government communications (Comtask), which finalised its report for Deputy President Thabo Mbeki last November, has yet to see the fruits of its research being implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Comtask convenor Mandla Langa, Mbeki has looked at the report and members of the team are scheduled to meet with him month-end. &quot;The deputy president wants certain things clarified before going ahead with our recommendations,&quot; he said. Comtask's findings include streamlining government communications departments and improving South Africa's media image abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debacle surrounding the Freedom of Expression Institute (FXI) and its chair Raymond Louw has been put on ice for now with no retaliation from Black Editors Forum chair, Thami Mazwai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FXI this week held a press conference explaining why it should head the investigation into the media on behalf of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. There has been a furore over the FXI's intended involvement with the Black Editors Forum claiming that it is inapproporiate for journalists (such as Louw) to investigate fellow journalists .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FXI deputy chair Mandla Seleoane says if the TRC decides against the FXI, then the institute &quot;will conduct its own investigation and present its findings as a submission to the TRC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tendering process for The Flying Springbok publishing contract has been postponed from January 6 to January 23 at the request of several companies, says South African Airways representative Mike Pheiffer. The magazine which is read by about five million passengers annually is being hotly tendered for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pheiffer refused to divulge who requested an extension but it is believed that Thebe Investments wanted more time. Other contenders are rumoured to be Kagiso Trust Investments, Penta Publications and talkshow presenter Felicia Mabuza-Suttle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng's auditor general Shauket Fakie has embarked on an investigation into alleged financial irregularities at the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) following staffers' complaints. Fakie said his office was from time to time directed by the public protector to conduct special investigations. The investigation will focus on expenditures by the IBA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British newspapers are trying everything to keep readers, but the latest Audit Bureau of Circulation figures indicate that most of the daily broadsheets, Sunday newspapers and even tabloids are freefalling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some newspaper groups are opting for a revamp by changing their masthead, while others are changing editors with the hope of &quot;finding the right one&quot; who will boost circulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jacquie Golding-Duffy speaks to the people behind the sweeping changes in current affairs programmes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch this week of a new current affairs programme - Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) - marks the revamp taking place within the SABC's television news department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has taken the new head of SABC-TV's Current Affairs division, Sarah Crowe, less than two months to begin giving her stable of current affairs programmes a facelift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her plans created in late October of &quot;changing the focus of current affairs slots&quot; has been put in motion with the go- ahead of SABC Television News editor-in- chief Joe Thloloe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thloloe says Q&amp;A is &quot;the biggest change in the reformatting of the current affairs programmes&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe agrees. &quot;The style used in the studio is common abroad but is a television style which is foreign to South Africa and will be seen as fresh and new to local viewers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q&amp;A, which will be broadcast on SABC 3 at 21h30 every Tuesday, encourages audience participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panelists for the first episode included Minister of Environment Affairs and Tourism Pallo Jordan, Pan Africanist Congress MP Patricia De Lille and well-known economist and commentator Magnus Heystek. These three personalities fielded questions from the audience on a central theme: Muslim fundamentalism and the Cape Town community group, People against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe says the old actuality format, especially the Tuesday Debate, was scrapped because it was &quot;getting tired&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new programme offers greater flexibility. &quot;In the Q&amp;A format we can tackle softer issues. The Tuesday Debate sometimes did not have a contentious issue around which one could develop a debate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Tuesday Debate host, Max du Preez, agrees. &quot;This format allows for more leeway and draws in ordinary people who would otherwise not have an opportunity to ask questions which they feel are pressing,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe adds that ''a myriad of subjects are discussed and viewers can hear what the major power players such as ministers, businessmen and others think of issues which are outside their field of expertise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Preez takes charge (or fails to take charge) of Q&amp;A as he did at the Tuesday Debate, which has proven to be a recipe of success for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stresses that Q&amp;A &quot;does not aspire to be another show of talking heads.  nor does it want to be another Two Way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about tackling issues via questions from ordinary people in the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thloloe said the revamp, which included a new, modern set that creates the illusion of space as well as brand-new logos &quot;did not cost the corporation much&quot; - an estimated R50 000. Most of the work, he says, was conducted by internal staffers using in-house facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the five new-look current affairs programmes are an effort to look at current issues in a different way and to give news a bit of depth as well as a cutting edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other current affairs programmes boasting a new look include Fokus with Freek Robinson every Wednesday on SABC 2 at 21h00 - to be a personality- driven show in Afrikaans and presented in the field. SABC 1 will continue to broadcast Focus at 20h00 where the main issues of the week will be discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will also be a Focus on Africa where it is hoped that stories concerning the continent will be highlighted and Focus Features, a new documentary programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides these changes, SABC is planning a monthly Focus on Business which will kick off on February 3 on SABC 2 at 21h00, followed by Focus on Media which will be broadcast on February 6 on SABC 3 at 21h30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first Monday and Thursday of each month, viewers can enjoy these special Focus bulletins,&quot; says Thloloe, adding that the Focus on Business is not aimed at competing with other business programmes. The SABC currently commissions a programme from Business Day called Business Tonight which is aired every evening at 10pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on Media hopes to look at &quot;broad media issues&quot; ranging from internal SABC issues to advertising and marketing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Evangelos Calamitsis, director of the African Department, replies to last week's criticism of the IMF's policies in Mozambique</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOZAMBIQUE deserves better treatment from those who, like Joseph Hanlon, would claim to be its friends. His portrayal of a country whose desperate economic condition threatens to reawaken unrest (IMF pulls plug on Mozambique, Mail &amp; Guardian, January 10 to 16) does an injustice to Mozambique's achievements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says &quot;the poorest country in the world is growing poorer&quot;. In fact, over the past decade, Mozambique's economy has grown strongly, despite natural disasters and a war. Since 1987, per capita income (at 1990 prices) has increased by 43%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inflation for the first 11 months of 1996 was just 15% and, since mid-1994, industrial production has grown strongly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanlon states that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has insisted donors spend on reconstruction Pounds 115-million less in 1996 than in 1994.  But the IMF welcomes donor assistance to Mozambique, and no IMF condition would be breached if Mozambique received additional foreign aid and spent it on reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1987, with IMF support, Mozambique has implemented adjustment programmes aimed at increasing supply, not merely reducing demand. They have eliminated domestic price controls, liberalised exchange and trade, and led to the restructuring and privatisation of loss-making public enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit to the economy in 1996 will have expanded by close to 32%. There are also credit schemes for small and medium-sized enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991, a cash transfer scheme for the urban poor and vulnerable groups was revived and now reaches almost 90 000 households. However, such schemes alone cannot resolve the problem. So the government, with the help of the World Bank and donors, is working on programmes to provide adequate spending on education and health, while reducing unproductive outlays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, therefore, hard to understand why Hanlon suggests that structural adjustment has failed. From 1981 to 1986, under central planning, Mozambique's real gross domestic product declined by 28% and per capita income by 45%. Exports fell. Food production declined and the country became dependent on food aid. External debt became unmanageable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now foreign capital and know-how are beginning to flow into Mozambique, creating opportunities for increased employment. Inflation is down, exports are expanding and growth continues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Entry-level cars are proving to be the motor industry's success story as new vehicle sales face a difficult year, reports Max Gebhardt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four successive years of buoyant sales, the motor industry is steeling itself for this year's slowdown in the economy. While car-makers remain bullish for future prospects in the industry, 1997 should see the first decline in new car sales since 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most leading car manufacturers say they will have to cut costs this year as the high levels of private sector credit extension and household debt and the prevailing high real interest rates deflate the last four years' upswing in sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) is expecting car manufacturers to face a difficult first half this year, as pressure on private disposable income and the slowdown in economic growth hits consumers' pockets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the growth in new vehicle sales wasn't as significant as the 1994/95 year- on-year growth, which saw car sales rise by meteoritic 24%, Naamsa executive director Nico Vermeulen said last year's figures were still noteworthy given the fact that 1995 represented a relatively high base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures released by the industry this week showed that sales of new vehicles had risen by 4,5% to 393 026 units in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new vehicle manufacturing industry's sales revenue rose above inflation, by about 9,5%, on the back of the continued improvement in sales to an estimated R31- billion in 1996 from R28,3-billion in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volkswagen emerged top of the stakes, selling one out of every four cars purchased last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vermeulen was also happy with the results of the motor industry development programme (MIDP), implemented in 1995, to reshape the future of the South African industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The MIDP has been successful in achieving various key objectives; namely, a substantial improvement in vehicle affordability in the domestic market, further growth in the vehicle market - particularly in exports - and an improvement in overall efficiencies and international competitiveness of the South African industry,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naamsa did take a swipe at &quot;certain stakeholders&quot;, who it said are sectionally lobbying the government to modify the development programmes in the MIDP. It said the approaches of these stakeholders are regarded as &quot; premature, unscientifically based and protectionist in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vehicle manufacturers and a number of component suppliers had embarked on major investment programmes on the basis of the MIDP and, while additional benefits of the development programmes would take some time to materialise, the industry requires certainty and stability in government policy, particularly for long-term planning purposes,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is anticipated that the MIPD would contribute to neutral balance of payments by allowing producers to import vehicles and components free of duty equivalent to the value of their exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naamsa expects the aggregate value of exports of components and vehicles to exceed R5-billion during 1997 compared with R4-billion in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This development programme, though, has been at the expense of local dealers and component manufacturers, according to some, with imports still exceeding exports by an estimated R12-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this will not be enough to halt the expected slide in the new car sales for 1997, which Naamsa forecasts to fall to 388 000 units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry analysts say car manufacturers have been riding the back of an overly optimistic market and last year's growth can be attributed to a number of factors that won't be evident this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Econometrix economist Tony Twine, manufacturers had benefited from the pre-emptive buying splurge by consumers in the latter half of 1996 as fears of a downturn in the economy took hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delta Motor Corporation's director of sales and marketing, John Cuming, says the relatively high number of new vehicle launches that took place during the year would have contributed substantially to the increase of new car sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is echoed by Johan van Zyl, managing director of vehicle marketing for Toyota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The passenger market performed well to achieve growth of 5,6%. This was largely driven by intense new model activity, linked to aggressive marketing campaigns and the growth of the entry-level segment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl said he didn't expect new model activity to reach the fever pitch of 1996 in the coming year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our view that some imported models that joined in the new model frenzy recently may not survive,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, car manufacturers are taking a cautious view of the road ahead and are predicting intense competition in the entry-level market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manufacturers at the moment perceive that the momentum is going out of the upswing and they will start looking at tightening their belts in the coming year,&quot; Twine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although last year was full of impending doom as the rand took a nosedive and the slowdown became evident, consumers emerged with the best deal in the car market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts are describing 1996 as the year of the entry-level car. Since 1990 this market has grown remarkably from below 2% to nearly 30% of the total new car market sales last year, while the luxury car market, according to Naamsa, continued to experience difficult trading conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the 25% depreciation in the rand since February, the prices of some smaller models are 18% lower in real terms than a year ago, while the average car price is down 5% in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Van Zyl, while overall prices did come down in real terms during the year, cost pressures currently being faced by the industry are extreme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will impact on vehicle prices in 1997. The first moderate increases for the year have already been applied,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vehicle prices are expected to increase by between 9% and 11% in 1997, but fierce competition in the entry-level market should keep prices fairly static.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the lifting of trade barriers against South Africa, our local motor industry has entered an era of competitiveness that has not been experienced for many years, if ever,&quot; says Delta's Cuming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twine said that intense competition in the industry has prevented the old reflex action by manufacturers of rewriting the price ticket on new cars. But the influx of new models below the R40 000 price level, the latest being the Opel Corsa, has not significantly altered the buying patterns of new cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private individual still accounts for only 20% of new car purchases, while the rest is taken by fleets. In the entry level, this pattern is slightly higher at roughly 35% to 65% respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the fierce competition might be good for the man in the street, this phenomenal growth in cheaper cars has been at the expense of the second- hand car market. According to industry analysts, the used car market has seen a drop in value by an estimated 25% to 30%.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Nozala head and new Johnnic board member Salukazi Dakile- Hlongwane talks to Madeleine Wackernagel about putting management skills into practice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding value is a favourite expression of Salukazi Dakile-Hlongwane's and one that she intends to put into practice as a member of the new Johnnic board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not enough to be part of management - we have to make a contribution.  And to do that we have to learn about the business,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As head of Nozala, an investment group run by women, for women, and assistant general manager, specialised finance, at BoE NatWest, Dakile- Hlongwane is well-qualified to make a difference. And this week's Johnnic bosberaad provided a perfect platform.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an opportunity for the new board members to learn about the business, discuss strategies and discover the most effective ways to make a significant contribution. All the new directors were chosen for their ability to add value; this meeting was about putting those skills into practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't plan any overnight changes; there is no point in disrupting things for the sake of it,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, shareholders' funds are at stake, so a prudent approach is appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The capital we raised as part of the National Empowerment Consortium has to be repaid, so we won't be taking unnecessary risks with our investment.  Rather, we intend to work together to devise the best ways of getting the highest returns on our money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nozala, conceived by Jean Ngubane, former convenor of the Women's Coalition, has been going for seven months and already its shareholder base has grown to 300 000. Its mission is empowering women, regardless of colour, and its targets are the media, tourism, gaming and recruitment industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We pinpoint economically active women within certain sectors. Thus, we have the Sactwu Investment Corporation, the Workers Investment Company and Afro Hair &amp; Beauty Salons on board, as representative of whole sectors where women are prominently involved. That way we hope the spillover effect will spread the word to other organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also talking to the Women's Coalition and the Women's Investment Group, but discussions are still at an early stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to distribute the benefits of Nozala's investments as widely as possible, the group selects only businesses with good growth track records.  Greenfield operations are avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wouldn't make sense to gamble on a new business; we have to concentrate on established companies that are obviously going somewhere. That's why we're targeting the financial services, hospitality and media sectors. That's where the growth will come from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making money is not Nozala's only aim, however. Dakile-Hlongwane is keen to emphasise the group's - and its management's - potential pedagogical role: &quot; I'm just a girl from Soweto and I made it. If I can do it, others can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her influences were her parents, both primary school teachers, who made huge sacrifices to ensure that she and her siblings were given the best start in life. &quot;Once you've seen someone go through those kinds of sacrifices,&quot; she says, &quot;you don't want to repeat the pattern. But too many children nowadays expect everything on a plate; we have to make sure they are challenged enough to strive for greater things. All it needs is commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nozala is not only about empowering its leadership either. Dakile-Hlongwane believes it has enormous clout as a role model although she admits it is difficult to reach - and teach - the most disadvantaged. But by setting an example and encouraging other black women into business, Nozala can help to change attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Job reservation for whites is not yet a thing of the past, she believes. &quot; If companies had started sooner in their training programmes, we would see many more black people in top business positions. The skills are there, but they are often just overlooked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon her return from a 12-year stint with the African Development Bank in Abidjan, CTte d'Ivoire, Dakile-Hlongwane worked for First National Bank, one of only a handful of blacks in management. &quot;It was hard for me to believe that they couldn't find any blacks to fill the trainee positions. Job reservation may no longer be institutionalised, but it certainly still happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Empowerment is not just a political issue but an economic one, and small businesses, often in rural areas, are an integral part of any growth strategy.  No matter how small the business, Nozala is interested. Dakile- Hlongwane points to Ashanti, an umbrella group for rural businesses run by women in KwaZulu-Natal, encompassing basket-making and other craft projects, which is keen to join up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are all important shareholders and we want to make sure we reward them well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With investors such as the Amalgamated Banks of South Africa, Sanlam Development Fund, Sankorp and Southern Life Future Growth, which hold 15%, Nozala is certainly not short of cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We kept the institutional investment to 15% because we didn't want to be tied. So now we are free to go anywhere, and invest anywhere,&quot; says Dakile- Hlongwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far that tactic has paid off handsomely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Top rating for Genbel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Micropal, the British-based fund monitoring group, has rated Genbel South Africa's top investment fund out of 14 internationally quoted South African funds with three-year time horizons. Genbel's net asset value rose 23% over the 12 months and 103% over the three years to end-November in dollar terms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New low for gold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gold hit a 40-month low in London this week of $352,45 an ounce, on good inflation figures from the United States and fresh concerns about European central bank sales to meet the criteria for monetary union. Gold acts as a traditional safe haven at times of resurging inflation when interest rates seem likely to rise. At the time of going to press, bullion had recovered to $353,85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rand steadies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The rand fell back slightly against the dollar, trading at a mid-rate of R4,6590. Traders said the rand weakened after New York trading had taken it to its highest levels on Wednesday. Corporates still sought dollars but there were plenty in the market after offshore banks sold. Against the crosses, the local unit eased and was last quoted at R7,8274 against sterling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infinity launched</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Leading black business group, Worldwide Africa Investments, in a joint venture with Genbel Securities, will be launching its asset management company - Infinity Asset Management - in Johannesburg next week. This is in response to the medium-term objective by Worldwide to have a strategic presence in the financial services industry. Worldwide will have a 40% stake in the company, which plans to provide resources to the under-serviced emerging black market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Confusion surrounds the sale of Transcell after Stella Sigcau stepped in to prevent the deal taking place, reports Max Gebhardt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privatisation has been dealt yet another blow following the intervention by the Minister of Public Enterprises, Stella Sigcau, in the proposed sale of Transnet's loss-making cellular phone division to MTN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ministry representative issued a terse statement saying that any sale of Transtel Cellular's (Transcell) subscriber base would have to be done in consultation with both Sigcau's office and Jay Naidoo's ministry of post, Broadcasting and Telecommunications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such a transaction cannot go ahead without consultation with the relevant ministries as it impacts on the government's telecommunication plans,&quot; the ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week it was reported that MTN and Transnet had been involved in secret negotiations to discuss the possible sale of Transcell's subscriber data base. Transtel, which made a net loss of R68- million last year, would have sold its R82- million loss-making service provider Transcell. However, this is now unlikely to occur.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cellular company has been plagued by a high rate of bad debt, fraud and material losses. Part of the sale would have seen the company outsourcing some of its crucial functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transcell, which is in its second year of operation, has a subscriber base of 22 000, making it the second-largest MTN service provider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market sources say the deal was being concluded by MTN on behalf of its subsidiary M-Cell, which manages billing accounts and had decided to enter negotiations with Transcell over taking control of its billing operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This did not mean it would be purchasing Transcell, as the subscribers would still be managed by the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacques Sellschop, group executive of corporate relations at MTN, said that at no time did the company feel uncomfortable about any discussion it was having with one of its shareholders - Transtel owns 20% of MTN - about one of its exclusive service providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe it is the prerogative of Transtel to determine the nature and extent of any national framework agreement-related (NFA) constraints, which may be perceived to affect commercial strategies in respect of Transtel Cellular,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connie Molusi, representative for Naidoo's office, disagreed. &quot;All telecommunication interests that are owned by the government are guided by the Ministry of Post, Broadcasting and Telecommunications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time that plans for the sale of the loss-making cellular- service provider have emerged. Early last year Transnet said that Transcell had been recommended for sale in terms of a working document on Transtel's future business plans. The sale was placed on hold as any recommendations would have to have been sanctioned by Sigcau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This latest battle appears to have been a result of the unions not being consulted over plans for Transcell. The proposed sale caught the unions off guard, said one source. At no stage had the sale been discussed with them in terms of the NFA - an agreement between the government and labour on the restructuring of state assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This seems to be at odds with statements by Transnet managing director Saki Macozoma that any sales could go ahead only after full consultation with the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molusi said that the two relevant ministers would be meeting Transnet managers as soon as possible to discuss the proposed sale of Transcell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the deal within the parastatal expressed surprise at the furore that has developed around the proposed deal with MTN. They said that at the end of the day this was just another business deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said that staff had been aware of the process throughout the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal had been misinterpreted, but, according to the source, this was common these days in the parastatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet chair Louise Tager was not willing to comment on the proposed deal and referred all inquiries to Macozoma, who could not be reached at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Public Enterprises has been under siege in the past few weeks from the unions as the privatisation process speeds up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sigcau this week resolved a two-week-long boycott by the National Union of Mineworkers and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa of talks on the restructuring of Eskom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unions accused Eskom management of attempting to privatise some of its operations without consultation. They alleged that they had not been consulted on plans to sell off three mothballed power stations, or on a joint information technology venture with IBM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a lengthy round of negotiations, the minister eventually persuaded the unions to return to the restructuring and transformation committee. The parties said they had agreed to revitalise the transformation committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Only one research body managed to avoid a government funding cut, reports Lesley Cowling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foundation for Research Development (FRD) has been rated top of the science councils for its research support division, and the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) has ranked last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ratings, in points out of 10, were determined by a panel of 16 scientists, technologists and other stakeholders last year after they listened to public submissions by the councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FRD's research support division scored 7,51 - 0,63 more than the nearest runner- up, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) - a score that places it way ahead of the pack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HSRC scored 6,31 - at the bottom of the councils, but better than the three national facilities, the National Accelerator Centre, the Hartebeeshoek Radio Astronomy and the South African Astronomical Observatory, which are administered by the FRD.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rating system was used as a guide to adjusting the funding to councils for the 1997/98 financial year, and also as a way of getting councils into the habit of assessing their work and justifying its worth. Only the FRD's research support division received an increase on its funding - an extra 1,55% . According to the FRD's latest newsletter, its allocation of the science vote will be just over R103- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other councils all had their funding cut, but very slightly -according to FRD News, none lost more than 2% of their previous budgets. The national facilities lost between 2% and 3%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology was wary of radically slashing any one council's budget, leading to the closure of some divisions and ending research programmes. Deputy director general Rob Adam says the department would prefer to base reorganisation on a more substantial examination of the councils, which is in the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current ratings were based on the council's own assessment of its performance in seven areas of activity, combined with the panel's assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These areas of assessment included looking at how well the council did in encouraging wealth generation, using human resources or generating new knowledge. It also examined whether the council was getting involved in partnerships in industry, offering a service, or supporting general research and using natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FRD did well because it began transforming itself several years ago and its new vision matches the principles articulated by the department. But another reason for its success may lie with its president, Khotso Mokhele, a vigorous and passionate campaigner for the foundation and its work. His presentation to the panel last year was persuasive - so much so that insiders joke having Mokhele on your team is worth a few ratings points in itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokhele himself was disappointed in the funding allocation, even though it was an increase on the previous year. The FRD asked for about R170-million.  Says Mokhele: &quot;We were quite aggressive in asking for what we needed. But we weren't firing an AK-47 into the bush and hoping we would hit something - like R110-million. We asked for R170-million because we needed it, and we still need it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the FRD will now actively campaign to raise the money from other sources locally and internationally. Otherwise, he says he would feel a sense of failing the scientific community, which has to do so much on very little support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever his disappointment, it is not as severe as that of the executives of the HSRC, whose low rating shows it to be struggling - still - with low credibility inherited from a previous era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HSRC president Rolf Stumpf says the council also did badly because the human and social sciences do not fare well when examined in terms of tangible results and measurable effects. &quot;It is much easier to measure the value of a new product that reduces emissions than the impact of a child-abuse programme.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged he was unhappy with the rating by the panel, which he believes is based on an inherited perception. But he pointed to the HSRC's staff complement, which is more diverse than any of the other councils, as a sign of how the HSRC has changed: &quot;White males are a minority.&quot; The council will continue to appoint black and female researchers to high-level permanent and contract appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf wants the HSRC to be reviewed again - by a panel of its peers, other human scientists rather than natural scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adi Paterson, executive vice-president of technology and policy at the CSIR, says his council did well in the ratings because of its performance in &quot; technology transfer, linkage to national priorities and human resources development&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSIR has about 13 000 paying clients and nearly 60% of its research is paid for by contracts, so it does well in the category of industry partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to human resources development, its in-service training schemes and links to historically disadvantaged universities stood it in good stead. But also, because the CSIR has a broad technology portfolio, it is able to get involved in a wide range of activities that make for good ratings in all the categories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One observer noted the CSIR may have done better in its ratings if there wasn't some feeling in industry that it competes with other companies and takes business from them. Adam confirms that the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology sometimes gets complaints of this nature, but they are rarely found to be valid. However, it is an issue that will have to be looked at when the CSIR goes through a more thorough assessment and a policy may have to be drawn up to manage this problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1997/98 budget for the councils is slightly more, in nominal terms, than the 1996/97 allocation. Adam acknowledges that, in real terms, this means less money is available for research and development, especially with the increased cost of equipment. But he believes it is nonetheless an encouraging signal for the research world of the government's commitment to science, in an environment of huge budget cuts for other departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new feature of the science allocation this year is the R10-million set aside for crime prevention. The councils have been asked to submit proposals for projects that could help bring down levels of crime, and innovative ideas will be funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be interesting to see what councils like Mintek, the South African Bureau of Standards, the Agricultural Research Council and the Council for Geosciences will come up with. But if they want to make up some of their funding, this might be the way to go.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When playwright Ronnie Govender - a former beer salesman and this week's guest writer - attended a beer sellers' reunion, he couldn't help noticing what had - and hadn't - changed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE giant fig tree behind the Umbilo Hotel stood reluctant sentinel to the beer garden which had seen better times. Layers of soot and grime on its forlorn leaves stubbornly resisted Durban's sub-tropical rains and the concrete fence lay cracked and listing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aged mongrel limped out of the way as I made my way past three middle- aged men with fading faces and fading clothes, lost in nostalgia - characters straight out of a Graham Greene novel. I entered the optimistically refurbished bar where the tills once rang merrily in that golden age when whisky was one shilling and sixpence a tot and cane was seven pence a tot and where I would not have been allowed to trespass, except as a wine steward or handyman. No wonder the nostalgic look on the faces of those Graham Greene characters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it was, I found myself being welcomed with a chorus of rousing &quot;howzits!&quot; and pumping handshakes. The occasion was the annual reunion of beer salesmen; some had retired and others like me had resigned after long service and had become members of a select group who had managed to keep their livers intact - survivors of a hazardous profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Elsworth (the names of the characters have been changed), still handsome and elegant, despite the rapidly thinning and greying hair, put his arm around me and steered me to the counter, yelling above the banter, &quot;Give the man a draught!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you mind if I have a Scotch instead?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mind? What a question, my china!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The glass was soon thrust into my hand and I couldn't help the flashback to that notable second day in my new job as a beer salesman, 20 years down the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had been virtually kicked out of teaching and was lucky to have landed such a sought- after job. I was feeling good as I parked my spanking new 1300cc Cortina alongside Tom's BMW and was making my way to the non- white offices when Tom yelled from a bunch of early morning smokers, &quot;Howzit Bobby, my china!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I yelled back, &quot;Howzit Johnny!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom stopped smiling. &quot;Hey, my name's not Johnny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't stop smiling. &quot;Well, my name's not Bobby either!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I walked out of earshot of the next sentence, which began, &quot;Give them an inch ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom seemed to have mellowed a lot since then. We were joined by good old Malcolm Witherspoon, my former sales manager. Malcolm was in his late fifties when I joined the South African Breweries and was now looking just that little bit senile, although he hadn't lost his charming smile. He was also genuinely glad to see me and tried to shout above the din, &quot;You're looking bloody marvellous! I think I'd better change my diet to curry too.&quot; That prompted another flash-black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was after my first week at the breweries and I was making my first weekly report- back. Witherspoon's usually easygoing smile was replaced by a look of seriousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Govender, this is only your first week here and I've already received a serious complaint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few seconds elapsed as Witherspoon held me in a steadfast gaze. As a teacher that trick had often brought me the desired result in dealing with a recalcitrant pupil. Unlike my pupils, I returned the steady gaze until Witherspoon said, &quot;I believe you were rude to Mr Smith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Smith was the manager of the Tudor-style White House Hotel set amidst rolling cane- fields. It was my first call at the elegant hotel, outstanding with its whitewashed walls and black-slated roofs. Protocol demanded that I first introduce myself to the manager of the hotel, but this was a little difficult, given the fact that non- whites could not enter the hotel through the front entrance. I entered the Indian bar, introduced myself to the Indian barman, Sunny, and requested a word with the manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bro, tune the Lahnee there's a new rep from the breweries. You know how it is, this is my first visit and he's got to check me out and all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No problem. Hang on, okay?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunny had to serve two public bars, one for whites and the other for Indians and coloureds. Blacks were not allowed on the premises, except as labourers. The bars were separated by a partition and Sunny disappeared through the linking door in the partition, to reappear later with the Lahnee, Mr Smith, who was the stereotypical English gentleman - tweed jacket (even in that sweltering heat), scarf and handlebar moustache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I leant forward to hold out my hand over the counter and introduced myself.  &quot;Good morning, my name's Ronnie Govender and I represent the South African Breweries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Smith didn't even nod and ignored my outstretched hand, which hung in limbo. Mr Smith was about to leave, when I said to Sunny, &quot;Bro, where's the tap around here? Maybe if I wash my hand, this ou will shake it.&quot; And went into an exaggerated imitation of the ritual of sycophantic servility which is expected of subject people everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Smith glared at me for a few seconds and walked away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My explanation completed, Witherspoon's exasperated look softened and was replaced by one of practised liberality. He said, &quot;I think I know how you must have felt, but believe me, things have to change. You have got to have patience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witherspoon was a supporter of the Progressive Party and I pushed my luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am sorry, Mr Witherspoon, my grandfather was patient, my father was patient. I am not going to be patient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that was missing was the soapbox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To his eternal credit, Witherspoon didn't exercise his authority the way the other sales managers would have. Thank God, for I had already been squeezed out of teaching because of my big mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soaking ourselves in nostalgia about the good old days, we were joined by Charles and Bobby - yes, a Bobby did join the breweries, much to Tom Elsworth's delight and my annoyance, and what's more, this Bobby didn't mind being called Billy or Sammy. He was an ever-obliging chap with an ever- obliging smile. Age hadn't affected that smile, although there was a little more self-confidence now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His pal Charles was ribbing Bobby. &quot;One thing and all, eks?, your bros know how to fix the wickets and all in India. Nobody can win there, eks?!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bobby agreed enthusiastically, &quot;Yeah, South Africa's too good for them!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles went on about doctored pitches, lousy chow, second-rate hotels and sounded like Trevor Quirk, Martin Locke, Mike Haysman, Peter Robinson, Robin Jackman and every other parochial South African cricket commentator and writer all rolled into one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought about the abysmal facilities that the majority of Charles's fellow South African sportsmen had had to contend with, even to this day. I thought about the complete lack of toilet facilities or change rooms at most of the grounds. I thought about Basil D'Oliveira who had to leave the country to gain international recognition. I thought about Parsuraman Thopplan, whom Australian batting great Keith Miller regarded as one of the world's finest bowlers but couldn't represent his country. I thought about South African bantamweight boxing champion, Kid Sathamoney, who, after flooring the Empire welterweight boxing champion in a sparring session behind closed doors with 16-ounce gloves, was refused a passport in order to challenge for the world title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought about &quot;Bomber&quot; Chamane, Scara Wanda, Sugar Ray Zulu, Dharrum Mohan, Carlton Moloi and Bob Pillay, who, given half a chance, would have made it into first division football in Europe in the footsteps of the first South African to have done so, Baker Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was getting just that bit miffed and was about to strike a sour note at what was otherwise a really chummy gathering when I thought about that other South African who, despite far worse, could still see fit to wear a number six rugby jersey. I also thought about my grandson who didn't know about Basil D'Oliveira or Parsuraman Thopplan and who was a diehard supporter of the South African team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, I tentatively ventured, &quot;But don't countries prepare wickets to suit their bowlers? Aren't the pitches in South Africa prepared for fast bowlers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles was in his element. &quot;You kidding? Those wallahs gave us sub- standard pitches. Okay, forget about the pitches! What about the lousy hotels, the dirty dressing rooms?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was about to say something like, &quot;It's a question of priorities.  Neanderthals like you don't understand that India, like many other countries, still has to work its way out of massive poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was about to let rip about many such home truths in the choicest possible metaphor, as I would have done when the country was being ruled entirely by racists, including covert ones like Charles, but stopped myself. What the hell! It's not the same anymore. Sure, we still have a long way to go before there is real change. Sure, Joe Parker and Mark Banks still tell the same tired old racist jokes, and white sports writers and commentators still drop racial innuendoes, but there's also that South African who can still wear a number six rugby jersey and smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I felt good that I didn't get on that tired old soapbox, as was my wont, and I really meant it when I wished everyone a happy new year as I walked to my car under the enduring old fig tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Playwright and author Ronnie Govender is director of the Playhouse Theatre, Durban. His book of short stories, At The Edge and Other Cato Manor Stories, has just been published under the Manx imprint by Bard Publishers of Pretoria</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It's no use just shouting from the sidelines about the threat to the National Symphony Orchestra, argues Bongani Ndodana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of the sad legacies of apartheid cultural policy was the false sense of security it brought to the arts. Provincial performing arts councils were formed and theatres, opera houses and concert halls erected as if to monumentalise the supposed cultural supremacy of Afrikanerdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eurocentric arts (a sad misnomer in itself) were given exclusive protection and allowed to flourish at the expense of indigenous art forms, not to mention the even more pressing moral obligation of social development and improving the quality of life of all the citizens of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This exclusive protection created a culture of entitlement among our privileged white artists. Their hands were unsoiled by the rigours of campaigning for funding to perpetuate their creativity. The state, through its cultural organs, was always there to keep the corps de ballet prancing about, or this or that provincial orchestra churning out a Mozart overture and an excruciating rendition of a German romantic symphony. Very few artistic institutions seemed to concern themselves with addressing the inequalities that affected their sphere of operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we have this development programme in the township ...&quot; But why on earth did it take so long? It seems that now, in this time of political correctness, one must justify one's existence through development programmes and outreach projects. In addition to these ventures being terribly overdue - by one or two centuries - most lack credibility and smack of mere tokenism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is that the audiences that want to see ballet or opera must be able to put their money where their mouths are. It's no use shouting from the sidelines, bickering and complaining. If folk want to see Carmen or listen to a symphony concert, the privileged folk must be prepared to dig a little deeper into their pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the point of audiences - be a bit more daring, explore the potential of your artistic palate a bit. Nineteenth-century romanticism does not define &quot;good&quot; art. This elitist snobbery is dangerous; one assumes certain art forms to be superior over others without judging the quality of the work in question and its intricacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An interesting drama unfolded in Cape Town recently. The Cape Town Symphony Orchestra and the Cape Philharmonic were both facing closure due to government subsidy cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was highly emotional to some Capetonians - here was a sacrosanct cultural icon about to disappear into thin air just because a black government was in power. On the other hand, most of the non- white communities displayed a perturbing yet sobering indifference - what good was the orchestra to them and their communities? How would it enrich their quality of life in their zinc-and-wood shack in Khayelitsha? Will the sounds of Katchaturian and Ralph Vaughn-Williams ever bathe the walls of Site B Hall?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor William Makgoba brought to the fore the issue of &quot;Africanisation&quot; at the University of the Witwatersrand. It is a concept that is highly underrated and often dismissed without any in-depth inspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 21 university campuses in South Africa. As institutions based on African soil, how many of them offer ethnomusicology - let alone African music - as a core degree subject? Why is there this infatuation with dead old German men?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theologians have coined a term - inculturation - which, loosely defined, means Christianity (or any faith for that matter) is adapted to a specific ethnic culture without people forsaking most of their rituals and the ways of their forebears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it is in this way that new artistic movements will emerge from the current South African scenario: by taking elements from Africa and combining them with elements from Europe, India, and the Arab world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibilities seem endless, as the demography of our nation is so diverse. This has begun to show itself in, for example, the choreography of Boyzie Cekwana and the work of the Co-opera Ibali Lomculo company, which is trying to demystify opera and bring it to little hamlets like Alice and Hogsback in the Eastern Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operative word is attitude - one can see this as the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning for Western arts. People will be forced to descend from the ivory towers and fight for their survival with rigorous marketing, effective and meaningful development programmes and passion. Yes, we will have fewer orchestras and opera companies, but they will be committed artists of world quality. Then, contrary to popular opinion, the music will never stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bongani Ndodana is a composer and broadcaster based in Cape Town. He is currently working on his second commissioned opera</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The National Symphony Orchestra (NSO), ditched last week by its sugar daddy, the SABC, finds itself in the position of most South African cultural organisations: under-funded and in danger of collapse. It will have to fight for its survival by attracting support in competition with such bodies as the Market Theatre or township art centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will no longer have a privileged position, but will - like traditional musicians or jazz combos - have to cut its costs and hustle for sponsorship to keep it alive. Those who protest will have to do more than that - they will have to dig into their pockets to ensure the survival, in some form at least, of this institution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope they succeed, and director Richard Cock will continue to have a platform for his unusually audience- friendly, open-minded and relaxed style.  For one thing, Johannesburg will be much the poorer without its November outdoor concert, replete with fireworks and mass waltzing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less honourable is the SABC, for whom the NSO stands as a symbol of the gradual neglect of a public-service institution. Under financial pressure, the SABC is being panicked into lopping off bits of itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, it is moving resources from those media events most important to a national broadcaster - such as the truth commission and Parliament - and favouring American soaps in a bid for a quick solution to its low audience ratings. Rather than build on what is unique and best about a national broadcaster, it is looking for quick, crudely commercial solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If one saw and heard evidence on our televisions and radios that the money being saved by ditching the NSO is being spent on better-quality news, or more local drama, or beefing up truth commission coverage, the news would be easier to swallow. But one fears it will only go to buy another American soap opera, in the hope that this will give short-term assistance to the SABC's dire cash flow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If you want to stick your fingers up the nose of the biggest guy on the block, you must at least have a good reason for risking a bruising.  Pious declarations about the sovereign right to sell weapons of destruction to whomsoever we choose, or solidarity with that noted democrat Hafez al- Assad, do not justify a confrontation with a superpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans have no right to dictate who our friends should be, but the proposal to sell tank firing control systems to Syria is a completely different proposition to keeping company with Cuba's Fidel Castro and Libya's Moammar Gadaffi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever one feels about the intransigence of the Israeli government and its past military collaboration with the apartheid regime, South Africa has no business complicating the peace process in the Middle East. Giving Denel the go-ahead to market weaponry to the Syrians is wrong, and not just because it violates the government's own guidelines restricting arms sales to regions where there is conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is the worst of it the fact that the deal is being promoted by arms merchants who learnt their trade by breaking the arms embargo and dealing in the stinking back alleys of the world arms bazaar. No, it is plain silly because we have alienated powerful international forces for nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is most improbable that the deal will ever go ahead. The only reason it got as far as it did is that Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who normally keeps a handle on matters requiring subtle diplomacy, was not at the Cabinet meeting where the leaked decision was minuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This implies a disturbing lack of depth in the government's decision-making capacity. The National Conventional Arms Control Committee, which with spectacular ill- timing backed the sale of arms to Rwanda shortly before war broke out in eastern Zaire last year, appears to have been duped once again by the arms merchants. Its chairman, that ardent moralist Professor Kader Asmal, has been uncharacteristically silent this week. The most generous explanation for his lapses of judgment is that he wears too many hats and is overextended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the bleating about national sovereignty by presidential aide Parks Mankahlana, the fact is untold damage has been caused for absolutely no gain.  Instead of imitating PW Botha and giving the finger to the world, instead of dressing up naivety and incompetence as doughty defiance, President Nelson Mandela should be figuring out ways to avoid such debacles in future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - MIRED in intrigue, corruption and controversy, the University of Zimbabwe is rudderless as the hunt for a new vice- chancellor yields few candidates of note willing to take up what has become a troubled command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last incumbent, Professor Gordon Chavunduka, quit in April 1996 after the problems at the country's premier institution of higher learning in Harare, proved intractable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corruption in the administration of funds which last year saw losses of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R4-million in payouts to ghost students, political interference, and an exodus of teaching staff has contributed to the decline of what was until recently an institution known for its high standards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A selection committee appointed by the university council last year shortlisted three candidates which included acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Graham Hill and Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Levi Nyagura. But an internal audit report recently alleged Nyagura had converted to his own use donor funds intended for a human resources research centre which he headed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academics have joined with the university workers' committee to demand his dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyagura, who has denied the charges, was believed to be the candidate favoured by Higher Education Minister Ignatious Chombo who recently said that the selection process would take as long as was necessary to find the right candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection process has been characterised by an absence of transparency and bitter rivalry among the candidates. President Robert Mugabe as university chancellor will make the final choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointments to senior positions have become increasingly politicised after Parliament passed the University of Zimbabwe (Amendment) Act in 1990, scrapping the royal charter establishing the university and giving the government far- reaching powers over its administration. The council is now dominated by state nominees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, who sees the university as a seat of opposition, was reportedly stung into tightening his reins on the institution by student demonstrations against corruption. Increased state control has been accompanied by declining administrative standards and growing factionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers regularly carry reports of misappropriation of funds at the university, but despite police investigations few prosecutions are brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over R5-million went missing from a distance education scheme in 1995 in a case still not fully resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say a suitable candidate for vice-chancellor would have to be able to unite a badly divided academic community and be of sufficient stature to tell the politicians to let go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation has centred on Professor Hasu Patel, a political scientist who had a long career at the university before his appointment as Zimbabwe's high commissioner to Australia where his term is due to end shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to a sound record as an academic and as an administrator he has another important attribute - he is a member of the ruling Zanu-PF party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE ambitions of Princess Diana to become an ambassador for Britain suffered a severe setback during her visit to Angola this week after she was accused of straying into the political arena by failing to back the British government's policy in her call for a worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The princess appeared to exacerbate the situation by pledging to extend her mission to other world trouble spots.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her high-profile move into a highly sensitive political area, it was claimed that she was directly backing the policy of the British Labour Party - which is for a total ban on trade and manufacture of landmines in Britain - rather than the government's official line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the British government is committed to an eventual worldwide ban on mines, in the short term it is prepared to concede the retention of &quot;smart mines&quot; that self-destruct after a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One British minister was quoted in two newspaper reports in the United Kingdom as having called the princess &quot;ill-advised and ... not being helpful or realistic ... Britain is one of the goodies on landmines and we are helping to draw up a sensible worldwide compromise package. We do not need a loose cannon like her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: &quot;The Princess of Wales was briefed fully on our policy before she left on her trip and as far as we are concerned she is sticking to that policy.&quot; He said that after her divorce from Prince Charles, &quot;a mechanism&quot; was put in place to ensure that the princess was always briefed by Foreign Office officials on any relevant aspects of government policy before setting off on any non-holiday trip abroad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ruaridh Nicoll follows Princess Di on her tour to meet Angola's victims of war as part of a Red Cross campaign to ban landmines internationally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Red Cross convoy passed shanty dwellings and huge piles of evil- smelling rubbish to bring Diana, Princess of Wales, to her second stop on the second of her four days in Angola this week - an orthopaedic workshop where men, mainly ex- soldiers from Angola's 20-year civil war, stood like flamingoes on their single legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tiny cubicle, she sat and talked to Sandra Thijica, a 13-year-old girl who lost one of her legs to a landmine in 1994 in eastern Angola. The little girl looked almost happy. &quot;She said she would have her picture taken with me,&quot; Sandra beamed afterwards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was Diana's first trip to Africa, and by the end of the day she had seen plenty of the bitter life many of its people lead. Angola, she said, was &quot;amazing and appalling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has now seen some of the rougher bits of this destroyed country, albeit from the safety of the Red Cross motorcade, which was flanked yesterday by a couple of the president's smart Harley Davidson outriders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point it ploughed through Luanda's thick, anarchic traffic, passing at one stage Africa's largest open market, where people were selling everything from beer to car aerials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which one is the princess?&quot; shouted one onlooker, evidently expecting a dignitary to be in the usual big black car rather than a white Land Rover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the convoy pulled into the Kikolo health post the sound of drumming gave way to the vision of well-toned stomach muscles rippling on the bodies their gyrating owners. On the other side were rows of women holding young babies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diana stepped in, a tanned white woman in khaki jeans and a blue sleeveless shirt, among the colourful, breast-feeding Angolan poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She picked up Andre, the two-month-old baby of Maria Bemba. &quot;She has come to help us,&quot; said Bemba. &quot;She said she will help us to get the medicine to treat my baby. He is ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Diana had passed Andre back, Bemba returned to her breastfeeding.  While the princess did not yet look comfortable in her new role of ambassador to the war- wounded, she seemed fascinated. One maimed ex-soldier, Bernardo Cupnula, called her &quot;the princess of peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lunching at a school which teaches landmine-awareness classes, Diana chose only rice from the table of food - &quot;You should be safe with that,&quot; she told me - and said that she would like to return to Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if I am to carry on with this anti- personnel mine issue, then there are many other countries which I will need to visit,&quot; the princess added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the room, workers were being trained to teach others how to spot, mark and avoid the nastiest legacy of these anti-civilian wars. There is supposed to be one landmine in Angola for every man, woman and child who tries to make a life in this forgotten country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overhead a poster showed a woman with her legs exploding, a baby on her back getting hit in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you walk please check your way,&quot; the caption read.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Frederick Chiluba is facing fresh claims in Zambia's supreme court that he has no right to be the country's president, reports Anthony Kunda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAMBIA may have fresh presidential elections, if petitions to be filed this Friday by two opposition parties against President Frederick Chiluba in the country's supreme court are successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five lawyers representing former president Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (Unip), and the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) led by Dr Rodger Chongwe have petitioned that Chiluba's re- election is illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers say the petition, lodged last week, would be heard by a full bench of the supreme court headed by Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties want the supreme court to declare that Chiluba, under Article 34 (3a) of the country's controversial 1996 Constitution, &quot;did not qualify to contest the elections, and to be elected president of Zambia, and that his re-election was void&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners also want the supreme court to declare that Chiluba had &quot; sworn falsely as to the citizenship of his parents and this is in contravention of section nine of the Electoral Act&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been recent rumours, as yet unconfirmed, that he was actually born at Chibambo Mission in neighbouring Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his presidential nomination papers, Chiluba filled out his father's name as one Titus Chiluba Nkonde - Zambian - who died several years ago. But a pensioner of Zairean origin named Luka Chabala Kafupi has claimed that he is Chiluba's real father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba has denied these claims, and some of his ministers and relatives have mounted a vigorous campaign to discredit Kafupi. Although Chiluba has been challenged to take a DNA test, he has so far refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition reads: &quot;That although the Respondent (Frederick Chiluba) has sworn for the purpose of his nomination to contest in the election that his father is Titus Chiluba Nkonde, a gentleman by the name of Luka Chabala Kafupi claims that he is the biological father of the respondent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakwiba Sikota, one of the lawyers who drew up the petition, said the parties will bring evidence that will show that Chiluba has, on different occasions, given conflicting names for his place of birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba has given his birthplace as Wusakile and Chamboli in Kitwe in the Copperbelt province. At other times, he has named his birth place as Musangu Village in Luapula province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lawyer for the opposition groups, Sebastian Zulu, said in Zambia, like in many Commonwealth countries, if a court is convinced that only a scientific test will settle the matter conclusively &quot;the court will be obliged to order a DNA test. Chiluba could be ordered to undergo such a test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe said, until the time of the hearing of the petition in the supreme court, Kafupi will remain at a secret location for fear of interference from the state. &quot;We cannot leave things to chance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikota said: &quot;The law requires that a person contesting the election should be a Zambian citizen and his parents should be Zambian citizens by birth or descent. As stated in the petition, the respondent (Chiluba) does not meet these requirements and his controversial national status ought to be investigated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other opposition parties - Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) and Agenda for Zambia (AZ) - have jointly filed a separate petition in the supreme court challenging the re-election of Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean Mung'omba, ZDC president, and Aka Lewanika, AZ president, in their petition contend that: &quot;There is serious evidence suggesting that the 1996 presidential and general elections were systematically rigged and fixed through unjust and fraudulent manipulation of the electoral process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said even the ballot papers and boxes used in the recent polls &quot;ought to be surrendered into the custody of the court or some other neutral institution other than the electoral commission&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electoral commission has been widely condemned as a composition of cadres from Chiluba's ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A SUPREME Court judge has been reported to the chief justice after ordering a leading campaigner for gender equality to adopt her husband's name before he would grant her a divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loretta Jacobus, the African National Congress MPL who chairs Gauteng province's committee on gender equality, says she was stunned and &quot;disgusted&quot; when Judge Geoff Leveson told her to change the name on her divorce application papers to that of her husband - Antonio Bastardo Ibanez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobus's lawyers sent a letter of complaint to Transvaal Judge President Frikkie Eloff, who replied that he was powerless to interfere. &quot;Judge Leveson is master in his court, and I have no say in the rulings made by him,&quot; Eloff said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The difficulty raised by Judge Leveson, as I understand the position, is that anyone who might be interested in having sight of the record of the divorce proceedings would look for the record in Ibanez v Ibanez ... Whether that is sound is not for me to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers then approached the then chief justice Michael Corbett. He passed the matter to his successor, Ismail Mahomed, who takes over in Bloemfontein this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobus says several women in the divorce court had a hard time the day she was there, last August. She told the Mail &amp; Guardian that when one woman was asked why she wanted a divorce she said: &quot;It is not working.&quot; She says Leveson responded: &quot;What's not working -the fridge, the stove, the microwave?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter to the chief justice, Jacobus's lawyer says her client believed she had been a &quot;victim of sexism at the hands of Judge Leveson which, in the circumstances, amounted to an abuse of judicial power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not suggest that Judge Leveson's petty abuse of his judicial powers should lead to his removal from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do, however, request that you consider whether his conduct amounts to misconduct in terms of the constitution ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should Judge Leveson be allowed to continue with impunity to act out his chauvinist prejudices on any woman who has exercised her entitlement never to adopt her husband's name?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the initial letter to Eloff the lawyer said that Leveson had sent Jacobus to the back of the queue when she refused to switch her name. Divorce proceedings at the Rand Supreme Court take place on a &quot;conveyor belt&quot; roll on Fridays, with judges taking turns to preside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobus's advocate told Leveson there was no legal reason for Jacobus to change her name, citing the Births, Deaths and Registries Act of 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding the above, Mr Justice Leveson was adamant that should the plaintiff want a divorce, an amendment would have to be effected to reflect the plaintiff's name as Ibanez,&quot; says the letter of complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The plaintiff finally consented to the amendment, despite her misgivings, as she had been waiting the entire morning and it had become apparent that she would not get divorced if she refused to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leveson told the M&amp;G that only Eloff was in a position to comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Amid the changes in the judiciary, an old- style attitude still exists among some judges. Three months as an acting judge was a learning experience for academic and commentator Dennis Davis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE demand for the transformation of the South African judiciary has become almost as plastic a concept as that of the rainbow nation. That the judicial system that was inherited from the apartheid system is ill- suited to the demands of a democratic society based on freedom, equality and human dignity is surely apparent to all but the most recalcitrant, some of whom re- emerged into the public limelight during the unfortunate controversy which preceded the appointment of the chief justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war cry, unfortunately, has not been accompanied by sufficient analysis as to the kind of judicial system which will be suited to the demands of the egalitarian society envisaged by our Constitution. Perhaps the reason for the striking lack of substance in the debate lies in the truly problematic issues relating to the transformation of the institution. Recently, I was privileged to serve as an acting judge on the Cape Provincial Division of the Supreme Court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a couple of months on the bench is hardly sufficient to gain adequate insight into the range of problems relating to judicial change, the experience was rather salutary for an academic who has been critical of the judicial system in revealing the complexity of the problems of transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first issue relates to the composition of the judiciary. It is trite that the judiciary is predominantly staffed by white males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That this legacy of apartheid must change is equally obvious, but the means to be adopted are not quite as simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had been some debate prior to 1994 that all judges should be interviewed by the Judicial Services Commission prior to re-appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubtless this development would have led to a number of retirements. The politics of transition dictated otherwise. Accordingly, the only viable alternative which would give rise to more vacancies on the bench would be to adopt the so-called &quot;Howard amendment&quot;, in terms of which judges who have attained the age of 65 years would be able to retire with the same rights as presently apply at the retirement age of 70 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears unlikely that the &quot;Howard amendment&quot; will be approved, in which case fewer vacancies will arise and hence judges clearly uncomfortable with our new society will continue in office until they attain the age of 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, it is likely that the composition of the judiciary will change rather more slowly than some might expect. Even if the &quot;Howard amendment&quot; is adopted, considerable care should be taken to ensure that the core of experienced, competent judges who have shown remarkable adaptation to the constitutional state should continue in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were these judges to resign immediately, it is unlikely that sufficient experienced judicial officers would be found to maintain a judicial system in which ordinary South Africans will obtain full benefit of their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brutal reality of apartheid was that its racism, together with the connivance - whether by omission or commission - of the legal profession, prevented women and black lawyers from being exposed to the full range of the complexity of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Nationalist government appointed many mediocrities (without much complaint from the legal profession), South Africans now deserve far better and, with some official imagination in looking for candidates outside the tradition pool, this can be attained, although probably over a somewhat longer period than was previously hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many of the recent appointments have been extremely successful, the existing pool of candidates is too small to effect wholesome change immediately. While I accept that my own experience as an academic lawyer is far inferior to many prospective candidates for judicial office, the assistance given to me by experienced judges in regard to a range of issues in which I have had no previous experience, was not only critical to my survival on the Bench, but indicated to me that experienced judges committed to change of the system are much needed to pass on assistance and guidance to those who assume judicial office. In short, these judges are crucial to the development of a Bench which adequately reflects the demography of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transformation also requires a change in support given to the judicial institution. At present, the judiciary is treated like a 19th-century institution in which a group of gentlemen use quill pens to produce their judgments. Judges do not obtain computers as of right. There is no research assistance available to members of the Bench who thus compete against practitioners equipped with the latest information technology and a team of juniors and attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is quite unacceptable for the judiciary to operate in this parlous situation with poor libraries, an absence of research capacity and no access to information technology. I found it difficult to obtain a dictaphone in order to ensure that my judgments could be typed. These developments began many years before, when the old government reduced the judiciary in status and in resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transformation is also about changing the nature of our legal thinking. The Constitution brought about a revolution to our legal system and this now requires that the judiciary be provided with research to enable our common law to reflect the values of our new society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a significant extent, the institution has been let down by the academic community. One example must suffice. In the area of crime, there is an extraordinary absence of decent research on sentencing options, concepts of punishment and general guidance to deal with the escalating crime wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unacceptable that, in a society faced with our crime rate, none of the criminology institutes has been able to produce the kind of rigorous research which would ensure that the principles of sentence, bail and punishment become coherent. The bench must be confronted with new thinking to ensure that it develops the law in accordance with the spirit of the underlying values of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A definite start has been made on the transformation road, with the appointment of Ismail Mahomed as chief justice, but the chief justice cannot do it alone. To me, it is clear that the judge presidents have a vital role in assisting the chief justice to change the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If one looks at the areas in which the judiciary has changed for the better, much of the credit for that should be given to the judge president of the division, a conclusion clearly borne out by my experience on the bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa needs to concretise the debate around judicial transformation.  Mere slogans and easy solutions will not suffice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Dennis Davis is the director of the Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits University and was a Cape Division acting judge from October to mid-December last year</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Angella Johnson Interview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soli Philander's patience is wearing thin. It is 3pm and he has been on the phone virtually non-stop all day, asking anyone and everyone for advice on how to clear his &quot;baby brother&quot; Anwah (18) of charges connected to a vicious gang rape. The present target is some poor lackey in the office of Jessie Duarte, Gauteng's Safety and Security MEC, who is getting an ear- bashing for her comments on radio that the teenager should not have been granted bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can she go on air and say that?&quot; bellows the usually cheery entertainer down the line. &quot;The police have no evidence linking him with any crime, yet people are talking as if he's a hardened criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philander barely looks up to acknowlege me as I enter the room. &quot;They are making scapegoats of us,&quot; I hear him complain.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife, Toni, is carrying the youngest of their four children, who is demanding a nappy change. The house, with a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign hanging as if at half-mast, has a hollow, empty feel. Children with big brown eyes and honey- coloured skin are running around, unaware of the drama being played out around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are rather chaotic because we were in the process of moving house when all this blew up,&quot; Toni apologises. Anwah is being kept out of sight in another room, supposedly to prevent anyone from the media seeing him before the identity parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is some time before the actor-comedian emerges from his telephonic mission. Eyes blazing and lips chapped from talking too much, he looks like someone on the edge of a breakdown. His wife's soothing fails to halt a rant coupled with restless pacing of the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that a terrible crime has been committed, but police in their urgent need to look as if they are doing something released information about myself and my brother. The media got swept up in the feeding frenzy and now politicians are jumping on the bandwagon and baying for blood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is interrupted by the phone. Someone from Lawyers for Human Rights is returning his call, but is unable to offer any help as the family already has legal representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is victimisation and the denial of our human rights,&quot; Philander cries in desperation down the line. &quot;No one can prove to us how my brother is connected to this case yet our names are being plastered all over the papers.  What am I to do?&quot; He settles for the phone number of another organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pacing commences again in earnest. Like a caged beast Philander pounds the huge reception room littered with half-packed suitcases: round and round, back and forth, flinging his arms about and talking virtually non-stop as if pumping himself up for one of his stand-up comedy performances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will his popular female character and alter ego, the sibylline virago Rosie September, reveal herself in full vituperative glory? As if reading my mind, he stops suddenly: &quot;I'm not performing. It's the only way I can cope with this nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been the worst possible beginning to 1997 for this refugee from the Cape Flats. A week into the new year he and his wife were sitting with his mother and brother (both up from the Cape for a holiday) on the back stoep of his Berea home when the dog started to bark wildly at the front of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The kids were asleep and my mum had been entertaining us with stories of her youth when she was a 'girl about town' and we were a having a good time because she's so funny. Suddenly all hell broke loose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they rushed to see what was causing the fuss, he almost collided with two armed men jumping over the garage gate. &quot;My first thought was that I was watching the wrong channel, so I blinked my eyes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he opened them Philander realised the two were being joined by several heavily armed uniformed officers pouring over the garden wall. &quot;I shouted for someone to phone the police and one of the men answered: 'We are the police.' He was pointing a gun at my dog and threatening to kill him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After ushering the family into the house the police explained that they were investigating a double gang rape and asked if there had been any strange phone calls to the house that day. &quot;I told them we had had a call from someone which Anwah had answered but the caller did not identify him or herself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anwah was arrested for alleged car theft and possible accessory to rape, and Soli found himself, as de facto head of the family, trying to make sense of the situation. &quot;I'm like an obsessive parent and my brother, as the baby of the family, is very precious to us. He's a good kid and he was with us and a friend at the time of the rapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand how the trauma of this scandal has affected Philander one must know he grew up in Elsies River, which then had the highest crime rate in the country and was riddled with gangsters. The family kept its distance from such activities.mmmmmm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his mother's Muslim faith - her first two sons were brought up as Christians and the other two as Muslims - the young Philander went to church and even sang in the choir. &quot;My mother brought us up with a tremendous sense of right and wrong. We may not have had much money, but none of her kids would commit a crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philander - real name Silamor - spent a year at the University of the Western Cape before turning to acting. He got his first professional role when the lead actor in a play fell ill and he stepped into the breach. He was an instant hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was on his way to becoming one of the country's leading comedy performers. But he says his really lucky break was starring in Waiting for Godot with Pieter-Dirk Uys and John Kani. It toured Britian and the United States. &quot;It was lekker. Here (in South Africa) I was being paid less than everyone, but overseas I got the same money.&quot; And he saw the outside world, staying in San Francisco for several months afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his return home he launched himself into cabaret, did stand-up comedy, won several awards for his acting and met Toni. Because she is white, they lived illegally under the Immorality Act for seven years before marrying six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although often quoted as saying: &quot;I didn't have a father&quot;, his biological dad died only a year ago. They had met only five times over the intervening years, so many of his early influences were feminine, until his mother married a prominent Muslim hawker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philander has a tremendous sense of family responsibility, perhaps embedded in his psyche from childhood memories of his mother left alone to care for two young boys. So when Anwah, &quot;a sensible kid and the pride of our family&quot; failed standard eight three years ago because he was scared at school, big brother paid to move his mother from Belhar to Woodstock in Cape Town. It nearly bankrupted him. Now he is ready to use his fame to help clear Anwah's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was himself in the process of moving from Berea, Johannesburg, because of crime. &quot;Our neighbours have been robbed at gunpoint and so the threat is ever- present,&quot; he says. So they found a pretty 100-year-old house in McGregor, near Cape Town, from where he can commute to his job as a radio presenter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Philander's 36th birthday on Sunday. What does he want for a present?  &quot;That my brother is exonerated and the police apologise for dragging our names through the mud.&quot; Then he can look forward to putting it all behind him and starting life &quot;in a beautiful town where my kids can grow up with a sense of community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this, I doubt that he will be sad to see the back of Johannesburg.  Whether the incident will taint his career remains to be seen, but at the moment offers for television and other work continue to pour in. Many people are even phoning to confirm bookings as a sign of support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The kitchen of a small house in downtown Sao Paulo, Brazil, is the meeting place of the Comissao de Familiares de Mortos e Desaparecidos Politicas (Commission of the Families of Political Murder Victims and the Disappeared), an organisation of family members whose loved ones were killed during the military dictatorship in Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kitchen is lined with filing cabinets that contain information collected by the families on some 400 cases of murder and &quot;disappearances&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in South Africa, there was no official investigation in Brazil following the military regime. Without any governmental support, it has been these families and human rights activists who have had to try to find information on the &quot;missing&quot; and the dead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 20 years since the &quot;disappearances&quot; the relatives are still trying to establish the truth about what happened to their loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the period of military rule in Brazil (1964 to 1985) thousands of citizens were persecuted, forced into exile, murdered and tortured. The official lists compiled by human rights organisations report thousands of cases of torture, 240 people murdered and 144 missing. Relative to other countries in South America, these numbers are negligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparisons to the 30 000 &quot;disappeared&quot; in Argentina are of little comfort to the relatives who feel that the atrocities committed by the Brazilian government have received little attention since the passing of a general amnesty in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a civilian government was instated in 1985, the families of the &quot; disappeared&quot; have continued to seek the truth and draw attention to the numerous atrocities carried out by the past government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups of this nature are not uncommon around the world, and such organisations have emerged in at least 16 countries. Most of these organisations have developed spontaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their roots lie often with relatives who have met as a result of their common experiences. Stories of meeting one another at government offices and police stations while seeking information about their loved ones are common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups exist in almost all Latin American countries and have also been established in African countries such as Chad, Ethiopia and Morocco. Similar groups also operate in Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Turkey, Croatia and in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These groups are diverse in membership and objectives, but generally share three common aims: a demand for information about what happened to their loved ones; a need for official acknowledgment; and a quest for justice in respect of those responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Latin America truth, social and psychological rehabilitation, and acknowledgment are generally placed before the need for compensation. As most of the groups have developed in the context of blanket amnesties, there is an ongoing demand for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impunity for crimes committed under military regimes is the issue that sits hardest with relatives of the murdered and &quot;disappeared&quot; throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission is one of the boldest international efforts to try to meet some of these needs. Unlike a &quot;blanket amnesty&quot;, the commission trades full disclosure or &quot;truth recovery&quot; for amnesty - thus potentially meeting victims' needs for truth and public acknowledgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, amnesty is justified as being necessary to ensure peace.  It is considered that prosecutions could not have been guaranteed due to inefficiencies in the criminal justice system and a lack of access to information necessary to sustain successful prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most victims would probably agree that an investigation like the truth commission is a necessary first step to uncovering the truth. However, the onus is not on victims to accept any amnesty agreements. Rather, the commission has the responsibility to explain amnesties and has to be prepared for the angry responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is critical that it is not demanded, either implicity or explicity, that victims are expected to forgive the perpetrators. Families' anger or other emotional responses to the granting of amnesty to perpetrators has to be legitimised and space provided for people to express their feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lessons from other countries are that amnesties are always unpopular.  Ironically, if the truth is uncovered, this may stimulate rather than eliminate families' demands for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the efforts of the truth commission, the varied nature of the cases and the impossible search for the truth means that the issues of the past can be expected to remain on the agenda for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the Chilean Commission of 1991 being reported as the most successful truth commission to date, today people still seek to report past cases and many are unaware that the commission even took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa we need to guard against the attitude that once the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is over, the chapter on the past is closed. For the victims of past abuses, the chapter only closes when they are personally ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can be more challenging than it sounds. Take one faction of the victims' group the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina, for example, who refuse any form of reparation and compensation. They will not even participate in any official investigations or bodies, and insist: &quot;You took them away alive, we want them back alive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps they only want others to experience the frustration thay have felt and are determined to offer constant reminders that, in reality, there is nothing that can ever be done to replace their &quot;missing&quot; loved ones. As bizarre as this extreme position sounds, if we are to truly sympathise with victims we are required to understand it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Brazil, the government has recently agreed to compensate the families for the murdered and &quot;disappeared&quot;, but the relatives say compensation was never their goal. They see this as the government's final attempt to buy their silence and close the book on the past, but without disclosing the facts of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the families of the &quot;disappeared&quot; in Brazil are referred to by both those from the left and the right as &quot;dinosaurs&quot;. They are seen as harping on the past. The society is tired of these mothers who will not be appeased or who cannot forget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real question is: at what point does a society become tired of hearing the voices of the past? In South Africa, despite even the most valiant efforts of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee, we can expect to hear the voices of victims long into the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge to all South Africans is to learn to cope with, and accept as legitimate, the ongoing anger and even impossible demands of victims who will continue their struggle for an ever-elusive truth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - MAGGIE Friedman, partner of assassinated academic David Webster and founder member of Khulumani, says her organisation has constantly stated that the full involvement of victims in the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is vital for its success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sylvia Dlomo-Jele, co-founder of Khulumani whose son, Dlomo, went missing in the 1980s, echoes these sentiments. &quot;Most of the time we are the people who introduce the truth commission to the victims,&quot; she says. &quot;By itself I doubt it would cope. It cannot go down to the victims. We are the ones who know how to go to them because the victims are among us.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khulumani was initially started as a support group for victims. It has been built into a nationwide body. But there has been no process of building a strong and powerful working relationship between victim groups and the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friedman says victims have experienced problems working with all three truth commission committees. &quot;For instance, when amnesty hearings started for the five security policemen who have applied to be indemnified for their role in a number of murders, including the Duduza hand-grenade operation, many of their victims' families were not informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although victims have indicated the need for reparations is desperate, it is ridiculous that the reparations committee will only be able to start with urgent payments 15 months into the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Violations Committee has done quite well with public hearings, she says, but there has been a lack of information and outreach programmes both before and after hearings. This leaves community members frequently confused about the role of the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dlomo-Jele believes the lack of active participation by victims in the truth commission, and a bureaucratic response to requests for help from their families, is reinforcing perceptions that perpetrators stand to gain most from the process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Solace in solidarity: An East Rand community is finding ways to forgive and forget utlast the truth commission that will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOWN in Duduza there is a lot of talk about the &quot;one-armed bandit&quot;, the &quot; spy's sister&quot;, the police informer, the mother whose daughters were &quot;fried like chickens&quot; and the sister of a dead urban guerrilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every now and then this motley group of women and men get together to search for the truth behind the terrible events that racked the tiny township on the East Rand 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the process, they are creating a new moral order in a place where evil once reigned - and finding ways to forgive and forget that are probably more effective, and will last much longer, than the official procedures set up by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I first met them, at a meeting organised by the Duduza branch of an organisation called Khulumani (isiZulu for &quot;speak out&quot;), Humphrey Tshabalala thrust the stump on the end of his arm into my palm, clasped my hand firmly with the only finger he has left, and said: &quot;You're welcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a surviving member of the &quot;one-armed bandits&quot; - the name given by police to a group of student militants who were infiltrated and given booby- trapped hand grenades - and he has come to explain how he dealt with the aftermath of the explosions that resulted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In prison, after I recovered from my wounds, a shrink gave me some sedatives. Later I saw a psychologist who helped me with hypnosis. But it is really I who made myself live with what happened. I said, 'Look, I have no fingers, my friends are dead, but I have to carry on,'&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew I had a strong cause. I wouldn't give in, and that's what made me heal myself. But if we have groups like these of Khulumani, they help us to find ways to be strong. This is very important because even if you try to heal, it comes back ... it comes back to break our hearts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to Tshabalala is the &quot;informer&quot;, Nicholas Shada. He was one of the young students recruited by police agent Joe Mamasela. Thinking they were members of Umkhonto weSizwe, they set out one night to blow up the homes of a local government councillor with hand grenades that exploded in their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shada gave state evidence in a court case that sent Tshabalala and the other survivors to prison for 18 months. &quot;I want to know why they (the police and the prosecutor) used me,&quot; says Shada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My colleagues have never held a grudge. But I feel small because the community has turned against me. People in the street look badly at me. I want to see Steenkamp (the investigating officer) and Scott (the prosecutor) so they can say why they did this to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puleng Moloko comes to the Khulumani meetings for a different reason. Her sister, Maki Skosana, was accused at the funeral of some of the booby-trap victims of being a police spy, before an enraged mob battered and burnt her to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family fled Duduza after that. We even had to bury Maki in secret in Soweto because the youths said they would take her body out of the coffin and burn it again. I was the only one who stayed. But I spent a lot of time being alone, because even my close friends were afraid to come and visit me,&quot; says Moloko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I was surprised and afraid when Mama Thobela came to my home and said, 'Look, you are also a victim.' She was very kind, so I came and after the first meeting, I felt like a weight had been lifted from me. I didn't know what they thought of me. Now I know what they think and we have found each other again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone has accepted Skosana's sister back into the community. Many of those who were convicted of the murder and sent to prison for a few years refuse to attend the Khulumani meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have a feeling they do feel sorry. One of them brings her daughter to the pre- primary school where I teach. Sometimes we talk about how her child is progressing. And she pays her fees very well and on time,&quot; says Moloko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I want them to explain why they did it. Whose idea was it? And why did they do it like that? (Skosana had broken bottles stuffed up her vagina and was battered with a rock before being burnt alive.) We, as a community, need to know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntombi Mosikari is the office co-ordinator for Khulumani and a founder member of the Duduza branch. Her brother, Ngungunyane Mashabane, was among those who died in the hand-grenade incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard the rumours that Maki's family were informers, and I hated them for that. But when we came to form Khulumani, Mama Thobela insisted that her sister was also a victim and she must join us. I was so relieved to meet her and now I say, 'Thanks, because you have united us.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosikari is helping Moloko's family find a psychologist for Maki Skosana's son. He was five at the time of the necklacing and has never been told what happened. &quot;He's now 15 and is hearing these things for the first time. He has never really been told about it. But he's a quiet and worried child,&quot; says Moloko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another family member once gave him a version of why he has no mother, and he went around saying he was going to shoot the people of Duduza. After I appeared on television saying I needed to know why Maki was killed like that, his teacher said he performed very badly. Khulumani is arranging for us to find a proper way to expose him to his past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zodwa Thobela is the gentle old woman who broke the culture of violence and recrimination that racked Duduza in the 1980s and replaced it with this kind of mutual support and kindness. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My two daughters were killed when police threw a hand grenade into our house in 1985. The corpse of one of them was taken by police to an open garage and the police invited passers-by to come in and 'see how we have fried these Cosas (Congress of South African Students) chickens,'&quot; she says.  The other daughter died of her injuries the next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My husband was detained. He got ill and died soon after. The police who did this are still getting paid. They have their wives and their daughters. I have none of that now. But when I speak about it, I get healed. I get better.  And I knew Puleng (Moloko) needed that too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five security policemen have applied for amnesty from the truth commission and have included details about the Duduza incident in their confessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamasela, an agent of the police death squad at Vlakplaas, has admitted that he infiltrated the group and supplied them with the grenades. The squad's commander, Eugene de Kock, has explained in court how his men made jokes about &quot;one-armed bandits&quot; long after the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Johan van der Merwe, former police commissioner, has claimed that the booby- trapped hand-grenade operation was sanctioned by President PW Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a truism that the objectives of evil men will always be resisted by people who cherish kindness and basic human decency. The extraordinary group of people who meet under the banner of Khulumani in Duduza are testimony to these values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They do it with dignity and a poignancy that is epitomised in the words of Humphrey Tshabalala: &quot;What use is it to send the people who did this to prison? We have learnt to live with what happened. The people who are living with their unjust cause will not find such peace. That is their punishment.  It is why we do not need revenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela last year considered sending Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri to Burundi as a special envoy, to dispense advice and represent South Africa in the Great Lakes crisis. Instead, he sent her to a trouble-spot nearer home - to the Free State as premier, to pour oil on the troubled waters there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matsepe-Casaburri confirmed this week there had been discussions about her becoming special envoy to Burundi but '&quot;national need&quot; had dictated that she go to the Free State. She said she might not necessarily have retired as chairman of the South African Broadcasting Corporation board if she had taken on the special envoy posting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job is currently being done by South Africa's representative to the Organisation of African Unity, Walile Nhlapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation about Burundi is an indication of how much faith top African National Congress leadership have in Matsepe-Casaburri's peace-keeping abilities, and possibly explains why she was first in line for premiership of the troubled Free State government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also an indication of the extent to which Matsepe-Casaburri's fortune has been made by top ANC leadership, casting doubts about her political neutrality while she headed the SABC board and her independence from the party line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Foreign Affairs has denied that she was ever in the running for the position of special envoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurie Nathan of the Centre for Conflict Resolution this week praised Matsepe- Casaburri's ability and potential as a peace-keeper, saying that he had been impressed with her input at recent conferences on defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said, in contrast, that her possible deployment to Burundi confirmed she was nothing more than an &quot; ANC apparatchik in drag&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This whole concept of redeployment between so-called independent organisations and ANC posts is completely destructive to the notion of an independent civic society taking root in this country. It makes a mockery of the byzantine selection processes we go through, as in the case of the SABC board,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE Home Affairs Department's control over immigration and migration should be handed over to a new ministry, recommends research carried out by a government task team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team - chaired by Wilmot James, the Institute for a Democratic South Africa's executive director - was appointed by Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi last year to study flaws in immigration policy. The current policy is proving to be inadequate, inappropriate, and in many instances unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team, which includes Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's wife, Zanele, academics, unionists and lawyers, is to compile a Green Paper on international migration. It will report to cabinet in May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researcher Sally Peberdy told the task team in Parliament this week that current immigration legislation was rooted in the racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia of past South African governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said there should be a fresh start, with a new Immigration Act as the cornerstone, and a new ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa needs to formulate a coherent, positive, proactive alternative vision of the role of immigration that recognises that immigration, properly managed, can be of great economic, social and cultural benefit to a receiving country,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current Act governing the entry and exit of non-citizens is exclusive and defensive in nature, seeking to protect South African citizens from the threat of &quot;outsiders&quot; who might jeopardise their livelihood and be a drain on the state's resources and Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While successfully keeping out many skilled foreigners, the policy, the department, and immigration officials have failed to stem the tide of immigrants from the rest of Africa, many of whom come illegally to South Africa to trade informally and are deported regularly at great cost to the taxpayer to their countries of origin. Researchers at the Human Sciences Research Council estimate that R210-million a year is spent on deporting illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990, 53 418 illegal immigrants were repatriated; by 1995 this had risen to 157 084.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has also recorded instances where the Act, implemented by Home Affairs officials, has jeopardised foreign investment and the entry of needed skilled people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peberdy said South African immigration legislation had been developed with the original intention of keeping out all people except whites, and from the 1920s onwards laws were also used to diminish the stream of Jewish people coming to South Africa from Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguing that the laws reflected the racial anxieties of the time, she described legislation introduced in Parliament in 1930 to control Jewish immigration to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She quoted an internal government document of 1926, titled &quot;Immigration of Hebrews into South Africa&quot;, which read:&quot;One in every four who has entered the Union this year is a Hebrew, generally of a low type ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European population of the Union is small and every possible endeavour should be made to strengthen it and to ensure the quality of any additions to it in order to preserve its position in relation to the hordes of native and coloured inhabitants ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Peberdy, the 1930 Act provided the foundation for the Aliens Act of 1937, on which subsequent immigration legislation was built. This subsequent legislation also vested enormous powers in police and immigration officers, giving them the legal right to make arrests without warrants - powers which are still used in immigration policy today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation also gave the state the right to refuse entry to individuals seeking to immigrate without giving them reasons for their rejection, a practice deemed unconstitutional but which still happens today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task team is to hear a number of viewpoints on immigration over the next months. While some researchers will argue that South Africa ought to be more accommodating of people from neighbouring states, others such as Hussein Solomon of the Institute for Defence Policy, will maintain that illegal aliens are a threat to domestic and regional stability and should be controlled more strictly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solomon told the task team this week that illegal aliens were contributing to rising crime, having a negative impact on the labour market, increasing the problem of squatting and were a burden on the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recommended bolstering border security and strengthening internal controls on the movement of foreigners within South African. His thesis was challenged by members of the task team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Amid new allegations from air force officers, the defence force responds to reports on racism, writes Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH Africa's black top guns have blasted their commanders, claiming the air force is as racist as the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a report in the Mail &amp; Guardian highlighted problems in the integration of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), with soldiers alleging the culture of army was still white and Afrikaans, and that racism was rife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week members of the air force supported their army colleagues, saying they experienced the same problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black officer in the air force, Lieutenant Sithole Fitholo, was assaulted last year by a major who allegedly mistook him for a thief while he was unlocking his BMW one evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a court-martial was held and the major found guilty, former Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) members in the air force are unhappy about the sentence: the major was admonished and transferred. They also complain that the command council of the air force is still white and that blacks have not been promoted since integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the training programme is very slow. Of 45 candidate officers trained last year, only two were Indian, one African and one coloured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence force said in response that it did not tolerate, condone, justify or conceal racist behaviour. &quot;All such activities, if brought to the attention of the defence force, are investigated and if members are found guilty, stern action will be taken against them,&quot; a defence spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of policy the defence force, like all other military organisations, discriminates only on the grounds of rank but never on the grounds of race, creed, gender or sexual persuasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman denied claims by soldiers published in the M&amp;G last week that Project Juggernaut, launched on the eve of the integration of the armed forces, was aimed at raising standards to make army life difficult for members of non-statutory armies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an attempt to emphasise discipline and standards in the army and was in line with international military standards, said the spokesman. The project was also aimed at improving administration and communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The impression that the project is aimed at frustrating former MK and Apla members is not true,&quot; the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the army did not classify offences at court-martials as racist, but as assault or insubordination. Since the establishment of the SANDF in April 1994, there have been five court-martials where charges of assault were tried, involving black and white soldiers. Four were convicted and one acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During 1996 there were 1 790 court-martials covering a variety of offences under the Military Disciplinary Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as the integration process is concerned, the defence force is generally satisfied. This process is a world first, and apart from some initial teething problems in 1994, it has progressed very well. It is, however, a complicated process,&quot; the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 21 000 members of non-statutory forces had reported to assembly points for integration since 1994. Only 3 700 had opted for demobilisation packages, and more than 18 000 had been integrated into the defence force.  The defence force was satisfied with progress made in its bridging training, although the large numbers of people requiring instruction had presented problems as training institutions could not cope with the large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The process is continually under review but does not give cause for alarm at this stage,&quot; the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Integration also includes a 'hearts and minds' element. This is a long- term process which will probably take a number of years. It is not possible to predict when this will be completed. There is progress. Not only must the organisation strive to change, but so must individual members of the defence force.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Professor Sam Nolutshungu's decision not to lead Wits into the next century caps a trying 14 months at one of South Africa's pre-eminent seats of learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October 1995: The Makgoba Affair. A group of senior academics accuses deputy vice- chancellor William Makgoba of mismanagement and of embellishing his curriculum vitae, sparking a row that rapidly brings the race card on to the table.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">November 1995: Makgoba counters by releasing details of his accusers' alleged tax evasion. Allegations are rejected by the university and are described by the academics as ranging &quot;from the merely spurious to the outright ludicrous&quot;. Tribunal set up to investigate the allegations against Makgoba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">December 1995: Makgoba suspended and threatens to release more information against ex-colleagues. South African Students' Congress and National Education Health and Allied Workers' Union threaten mass action unless Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu intervenes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 1996: Vice-Chancellor Robert Charlton assures parents protest action will not lead to cancelled lectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">February and March 1996: Lawyers Dennis Davis and Cecil Wulfson broker a resolution of the Makgoba affair. Apologies all round, but vicious conflict exacerbates leadership crisis. Makgoba takes a lower-profile role in medical research at Wits, which includes analysing human sperm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 1996: Speculation around contenders for new vice-chancellor hots up and Wits Transformation Front (WTF) dumps Makgoba. University of the North Vice-Chancellor Njabulo Ndebele emerges as the new favourite among champions of rapid transformation - a view shared by the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 1996: Wits advertising campaign aimed at countering its reputation of becoming a &quot;third-world&quot; institution sparks allegations of anti- Semitism. The advert contained Derek Bauer cartoons of classic anti-Semitic representations in satirical portrayals of dinner party conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October 1996: Tortuous selection process for new vice-chancellor designed to appease all factions comes to a close with public grilling of all candidates. Nolutshungu pips deputy vice-chancellor June Sinclair as Ndebele comes last in the voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">December 1996: Government cuts Wits subsidy by R36-million for 1997. Top academics announce they are leaving. Sinclair decides against re-applying for her post after contract expires. Considers other options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 1997: Nolutshungu pulls out. Makgoba recommends university consults a witch doctor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - DR MAKI Mandela, the state president's daughter who led the affirmative action drive at the University of the Witwatersrand, has quietly quit the university for a top human resources post at parastatal Transnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wits and Transnet confirmed this week that Mandela had secured a post at Spoornet, the parastatal's railway division.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet human resources executive director Joe Ndhlela said Mandela, who is currently abroad, would have a &quot;senior human resources post&quot; in the organisation. Her appointment would be subject to a probation period, to ensure it made commercial sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her departure represents a blow to Wits. She headed the university's affirmative action drive - seen as a major component in its attempts to meet growing demands for its transformation. Mandela, who was in the job for more than two years, was requested by the university council last month to compile a progress report on her work, due to be handed in next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her resignation is the latest in a string of high-profile losses which is threatening to denude the campus of its best administrative brains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the other recent departures from Wits are applied mathematics professor Michael Sears and zoology professor Robin Crewe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading historian Professor Charles van Onselen was recently interviewed for a top post at Oxford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's relationship with her father became strained when in 1994 she publicly called on people not to vote for the ANC, declaring her support for the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The problem with Wits's transparent process for choosing a new vice-chancellor is that there was no Plan B</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE bombshell which Sam Nolutshungu dropped on the University of the Witwatersrand this week - that he would not take up the post of vice- chancellor - had as much to do with his nerve as his health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends of the enigmatic United States- based political science professor say he had grown increasingly anxious that the post - vaunted as the toughest job in South African tertiary education - was beyond him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Nolutshungu and Wits have officially pinned his decision only on health. But Nolutshungu (51), who avoided inquiries from the Mail &amp; Guardian, this week told the Democrat and Chronicle, his local paper in Rochester, New York, that he is &quot;not that sick or crippled. I just don't feel robust enough for the job.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;My health circumstances have changed since I visited South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is not quitting the University of Rochester, where he is interim director of the Frederick Douglass Institute for Afro- American Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wits, meanwhile, facing possibly the biggest crisis in its 75-year history, is unsure what to do next. The elaborate selection process, designed to appease all the university's constituencies, including the radical South African Students' Congress, was lauded at the time as a model for transparent recruitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not accompanied by a Plan B. Insiders struggled this week to name possible replacements. &quot;If Nolutshungu doesn't want it why should anyone else?&quot; asked a senior academic. Another said Wits is now &quot;in a state of political paralysis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu's victory in October in the contest to succeed Robert Charlton was hailed as a breakthrough for the troubled university. After 31 years abroad, Nolutshungu was an outside candidate - until the day he charmed the campus with a witty public presentation on why he should have the job. Since then Nolutshungu has been toasted as the best and probably only choice, particularly by Wits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration, however, neglected to make clear that Nolutshungu had never signed on the dotted line - Nolutshungu and Wits were still negotiating his package late last month. It also emerged this week that Wits was supposed to have put Nolutshungu through a medical examination before handing him the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection rules say the new man should be &quot;industrious, energetic and in good health&quot;. It is understood the panel which discussed the clause suggested the chosen candidate be examined. Nolutshungu was not, however, examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the first time Nolutshungu has jilted Wits. He was offered a deputy vice- chancellorship in 1992, which he turned down. He was supposed to start shadowing Charlton in June this year before taking over next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and colleagues say that apart from health troubles, Nolutshungu had grown increasingly daunted by the factious, politically charged environment at Wits. It is understood many in the academic world warned him of the dangers of the job. Nolutshungu was also uncomfortable being in the public eye. He has also put down deep roots in Rochester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he returned to South Africa in December, Nolutshungu was deeply troubled by the university's finances - in particular the government's decision to cut its subsidy by R36-million - and by the exodus of top staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders fear it will be very difficult to find a replacement. It is unlikely the two candidates who were beaten by Nolutshungu - the former vice- principal and deputy vice- chancellor, June Sinclair, and the one-time favourite, the University of the North Vice-Chancellor, Njabulo Ndebele - would want the job, even if Wits wanted them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say there is no clear indication who could take Nolutshungu's place.  &quot;It is too early to think about people ... we first have to come up with a process,&quot; said one selection committee member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some say it would be damaging to repeat the &quot;exhausting and time-consuming&quot; process - one Nolutshungu described in November as &quot;long, cumbersome and tiresome&quot;. But others say there is no option if the university wants to avoid a full-blown crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-chair of Wits's transformation task team, Professor Shadrack Gutto, said this week that Wits was not yet sure how to appoint a replacement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded the university should have made it clearer last year that Nolutshungu had only been offered the job and had not yet accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you have to understand the mood of the institution at the time. People wanted to know if Nolutshungu would be starting tomorrow. It was not a normal process ... special situations were prevailing and we were carried away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gutto said that after completing the selection process - &quot;the most transparent ever&quot; - there was no question the winning man, Nolutshungu, would pull out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was sure Nolutshungu himself had appreciated the special nature and enormous challenge of the job. But he said the university would probably need to &quot;bring it (the challenge of the job) out more in the next interview process. We will have to make it more explicit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gutto said the most immediate problem facing the university was the appointment of three deputy vice-chancellors by the end of the year - a process Nolutshungu was supposed to have been involved in to help appease all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gutto was confident a replacement would be found. He said now that the selection procedure had been tested and had been shown to work, more potential candidates would come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele could not be reached for comment but Sinclair, whose contract as deputy vice-chancellor in charge of student affairs ended in December, said she would consider the post if offered it, as one of several options before her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another option she is considering, according to elite Johannesburg school, Crawford College, is to guide its plans to set up an &quot;Ivy League&quot; university in Sandown. Sinclair confirms she has had talks with Crawford.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CABINET ministers are likely to come under fire from the African National Congress's senior cadres this weekend over government failings in meeting its most ambitious election promise - a better life for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to divine how bitter the discussions at the lekgotla, which began on Thursday, will be. But senior party leaders in Shell House have come to the meeting armed with reports of apathy among the rank and file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also pepped up by criticism that government has sold out on the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) - an audit Shell House commissioned for the lekgotla paints a dismal picture of RDP performance, with most departments judged to have fouled up what was once the central component of the ANC's manifesto.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cabinet and premiers have been promoting growth strategies, wrestling with government structures and extending influence overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell House, meanwhile, has been watching the slow decline of party spirit, and the loss of commitment in the larger constellation of civil organisations which once made up the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM) - the volunteer workforce the ANC is going to have to mobilise for the 1999 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The MDM has been run down and is battling to redefine itself. The problem is that a weak MDM is essentially a weak ANC,&quot; said a senior Shell House source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the points to be discussed at the lekgotla is the revival of the MDM, with and through the revamping of the RDP. It is expected that Shell House leaders, Cosatu and South African Communist Party representatives will call on Cabinet ministers and provincial leaders to demonstrate that they are creating jobs, providing electricity and redistributing wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authors of Shell House's damning RDP audit blame the Finance Department's growth strategy for eclipsing the ANC's RDP goals, and crushing its spirit.  The audit is expected to be played as a tactical card, and not necessarily thrown down as a challenge to those in Cabinet. However, senior officials hope to jump on the defensiveness of Cabinet to bolster the cause of the RDP so it can be used to motivate the masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Shell House source said this week: &quot;We want to take seriously the new spaces that open up and encourage the people to assume a lot of responsibility - local government is one such space. We hope to introduce participatory budgeting so that people have input from the townships and the community understands the restraints on resources ... We must become active in community policing forums. There was a time when we mobilised the people against crime, but now it's Pagad, mobilising against the ANC in government ..  .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another worry to Shell House is the weakness of branches, financially and in terms of membership. Numbers of paid-up members have fallen since 1994.  Shell House sources say many who joined in 1994 have failed to renew their membership, either because they had forgotten or because they thought it was a one-off payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not expected that any province has paid up membership of more than 100 000, with the North-West and the Western Cape climbing to 40 000 each, and Gauteng pegged at about 50 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Pan Africanist Congress says it is not sold on the idea of a coalition with the ANC and is committed to remaining in opposition to the ruling party until the 1999 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAC general secretary Michael Muendane, who was part of his organisation's delegation to a meeting with President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday, said the party was sceptical that it could be offered a senior Cabinet position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the PAC is in any mood right now to join the Government of National Unity in a junior role, and I don't think at the end of the day the ANC will agree to give us a senior Cabinet position ... We are not focused right now on a seat in the Cabinet, we are going into government into 1999 and we are too busy right now to get bogged down in such practicalities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muendane said the PAC was more concerned with a demand raised in the meeting that PAC members be included in South Africa's civil service. The PAC wanted its members in the foreign service, the defence force, the intelligence service, the police and the prisons service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party has once again declared its intent to forge new political alliances, this week declaring 1997 the year in which it would &quot; brake (sic) the ANC's present domination&quot;. The party vowed to do the same last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NP executive committee bosberaad decided it would seek cooperation with other parties, community leaders and community organisations with the goal of establishing a new political party. &quot;The NP's objective of providing a stronger alternative to the ANC is based on our conviction that the ANC has abandoned the country's voters,&quot; said a NP statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said it would approach &quot;all leaders with whom the NP has potential common ground&quot; to restructure the political playing field. The Democratic Party and Inkatha would be first on its list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dolphin Group head Ketan Somai has denied accusations of fraud made by Nairobi, writes Justin Arenstein</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE man behind the mysterious deal to give the Dolphin Group control over prime Mpumulanga nature reserves for 50 years is at the centre of a huge financial controversy in Kenya involving more than R30-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ketan Somaia, chief executive and president of Dolphin, is alleged to be tied to two London-based companies which failed to deliver on a Kenyan government arms contract and owe Pounds 4-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report before the Kenyan Parliament from its public accounts committee has ruled that no company associated with Somaia may get any government tender. It is alleged that the committee and the Kenyan attorney general are pursuing him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin's deal with the Mpumalanga Parks Board gives it exclusive rights to exploit famous sights such as the Blyde River Canyon. It also binds the Parks Board to setting up, staffing and supporting a commercial office for Dolphin for at least a year with public funds. In exchange, Dolphin will bankroll the board's budget deficit over the 50-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia's Johannesburg lawyers fervently denied the allegations on Thursday and threatened to interdict this newspaper if it published them. However, reports in Kenyan papers allege that Somaia now avoids returning to Kenya and has based himself in Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a member of the Kenyan parliamentary committee on public accounts told the Mail &amp; Guardian that they had tried three times to have Somaia appear before them to answer the allegations and were still trying, as was the country's attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's High Commission in Nairobi confirmed this week Somaia had been the subject of considerable media attention over the past two years, after allegedly misappropriating funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems that Somaia has good political connections with the ruling party here and so despite being sought by the public accounts committee, the government has not yet organised his extradition or anything similiar,&quot; explained High Commission spokesperson Gerald Ockotch. &quot;The opposition party, however, chairs the public accounts committee and is pursuing the matter via the press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin's South African representative, Mike Sharpes, dismissed the allegations, saying that the public accounts committee had cleared Somaia in December after discovering that he was not linked to the company which had defaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And lawyer Janet MacKenzie of Cliffe Dekker &amp; Todd, acting for Dolphin and Somaia, threatened to interdict the M&amp;G if it published these allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She provided a copy of a letter from the chairman of the public accounts committee, M Wamalwa, saying that Somaia &quot;is not required to appear before the committee&quot;. The letter was dated December 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been instructed by our clients that a company totally unconnected to our clients had defaulted on the tender. Despite this fact, Mr Somaia was requested to appear before the committee. Documentary proof was then submitted to the committee which demonstrated that neither Dolphin nor Mr Somaia were connected to the company in question. Upon receipt of this documentation, a letter was addressed by the chairman of the committee to Mr Somaia advising him that he would not be required to appear before the committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wamalwa, the author of the letter, was out of Nairobi and could not be contacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G spoke to opposition parliamentarian Joseph Martin Sikuku, who sits on the committee, and he rejected any suggestion that Somaia had been cleared.  &quot;To say we aren't looking for Somaia is not true,&quot; he said. &quot;He has still to come and testify before us and anything else is a lie.&quot; Committee minutes made it clear that he was still under suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, conservationists in Mpumalanga have threatened to refer the controversial deal to the Public Protector. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) executive director Jon Hanks is among a group of conservationists who say they will approach Public Protector Selby Baqwa unless the Mpumalanga Parks Board addresses their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists have expressed outrage at the secrecy and lack of consultation surrounding the deal. They confronted parks board chief Alan Gray at a special joint meeting between the board and the province's environmental council this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WWF's Hanks said in a letter to the parks board chairman Patrick Maduna that the board had never given Gray a mandate to sign the contract which he described as &quot;the most important agreement in the history of conservation in Mpumalanga&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal's other clauses bind the board to doing everything in its power to &quot;maximise&quot; financial returns for Dolphin while &quot;using its best endeavours&quot; to obtain all necessary permits, licences and approvals for Dolphin to make a profit in Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the presence of clauses aimed at preventing environmental damage, conservationists argue the parks board will be lenient with plans as Dolphin will be bankrolling it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent break from normal management practices, the board also promises to consult Dolphin on any impending internal policy changes which could hit Dolphin's profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts are concerned the deal may be creating a tourism monopoly in the region. They note Dolphin has an unusual &quot;back door&quot; for quitting the deal in the form of a clause which allows it to get out if there is a drop in tourist numbers, civil unrest or policitical instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray has consistently refused to comment on the contract but did appoint a Johannesburg public relations firm after the M&amp;G first reported on the deal.  The public relations firm Gillian Gamsy International also handled media relations for Dolphin, and for plans to develop Zoo Lake under the guise of black empowerment, which were scuppered in 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE SABC is due to publish next month a history of itself, which has so far cost R150 000 and avoids the public broadcaster's controversial past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 200-page book, called The Voice, the Vision: The 60-Year Hstory of the SABC, is believed to be a light-hearted account of the corporation's past, failing to highlight the then-National Party government's stranglehold on the broadcaster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor and author of the book, 38-year-old Malcolm Theunissen, says the book deliberately does not &quot;dwell on political and contentious aspects&quot; as &quot; this ground has been covered several times by the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This book is meant to be a nostalgic, enjoyable read aimed at the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It covers the advent of radio in South Africa and where we stood in comparison with the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theunissen says he could have chosen to write the SABC's history from a political viewpoint but it he chose to steer the editorial away from politics towards &quot;development of the public broadcaster''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of SABC Corporate Marketing Pat Pillai agrees that it was Theunissen's editorial prerogative to write the book in whichever fashion he chose, adding that he had &quot;no problem with the content&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - EXECUTIVE members of the South African Football Association (Safa) are preparing to sack their former boss, Solomon Morewa, after this week's damning indictment by Judge Benjamin Pickard of financial irregularities in local football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safa executive members contacted by the Mail &amp; Guardian said they would continue to support Morewa as president while he remained in office. But they also respected the authority of the Pickard Commission and its recommendations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next executive meeting is scheduled for February 9 and Morewa's fate will be decided then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an organisation we accepted the establishment of the commission and offered our support and co-operation during its sittings. Our standpoint remains the same,&quot; said executive member Molefi Olifant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the commission's recommendations were being &quot;investigated&quot; by executive members. Olifant believed Safa should look at the merits of the recommendations before making its standpoint known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pickard's report calls for the Safa executive to &quot;insist on the resignation of Mr Morewa, failing which steps should be taken to dismiss him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report criticises the relationship between Morewa, Kaizer Motaung, the managing director of Kaizer Chiefs Football Club, and Brian Mahon, chief executive of Awesome Sports International, which acted as Safa's marketing agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Awesome emasculated South African football using Safa's assets against it, in such a way that football was no longer run by Safa but Awesome,&quot; Sports Minister Steve Tshwete said in releasing the commission's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Safa executive, Danny Jordaan, disputed earlier media claims that Safa was no longer an independent body. &quot;Safa's independence is very much intact. Minister Tshwete made it quite clear that the decision regarding Morewa would come from the executive and not any outside body like the government,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan said nobody &quot;stole&quot; money from Safa as was alleged during the commission's hearings. &quot;If money disappeared illegally from Safa's coffers, why does the report not recommend criminal charges against anybody?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshwete expressed the hope that the executive would implement the commission's recommendations but added the government would not dictate terms to Safa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuben Mahlalela, also an executive member of Safa, expressed his discontent that the report did not offer proof of the alleged payment of R28- milliion into Swiss and Irish bank accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am dissatisfied that the commission made so little mention of the R28- million payment when this was the direct cause for its establishment,&quot; said Mahlalela. He also questioned the legitimacy of Judge Pickard: &quot;Remember, he hanged former comrades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive members also questioned the manner in which the commission conducted &quot;a one-man search&quot; - &quot;It was never really about the executive or about Safa, but about one man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Tshwete said he would not set up a commission to investigate financial irregularities in local rugby after receiving a document from Brian van Rooyen, former vice-president of the Transvaal Rugby Union. &quot;There is not enough compelling evidence,&quot; said Tshwete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Rooyen was in the news late last year after failing in his bid for the presidency of the union. &quot;In light of the evidence given before the Pickard Commission pertaining to football, I believe the document I submitted to Tshwete warrants a similar commission for rugby,&quot; Van Rooyen told the M&amp;G this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His 500-page document details alleged illegal financial practices by the South African Rugby Football Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's former chief executive officer, Edward Griffiths, said he would be willing to testify before such a commission but added: &quot;I haven't seen Van Rooyen's document and therefore cannot say whether it warrants a commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The controversial Syrian arms deal seems to have been leaked in an attempt to scupper it, reports Stefaans BrUmmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE government's handling of the partially approved R3-billion arms deal with Syria has exposed deep divisions in official thinking on the crucial foreign policy area of arms control - and the leak of Cabinet minutes appeared a deliberate attempt to scupper the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fingers were pointed this week at the Department of Foreign Affairs as the source of the leak as it is one of the few parties, apart from the Cabinet ministers themselves, to have had close enough knowledge of the process to supply the information, first published in the Sunday press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department this week stood by an official statement issued on Tuesday which sought to downplay the significance of the conditional &quot;contracting approval&quot; given by Cabinet on December 4 to state-owned arms conglomerate Denel. A representative said there was nothing to add for now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a senior foreign affairs official said privately that while he did not agree with the tactic used to try to scupper the deal, the &quot;time-buying&quot; exercise signalled by the statement meant that &quot;the leakage, in my view, has been successful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some foreign affairs officials are known to have been upset with what they regard as an erratic government approach to foreign policy. Said one this week: &quot;Foreign affairs makes an input in such matters. Ours is perhaps more directed to political consequences than other (departments) ... We have to accept a decision, but if something goes wrong we have to carry the can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tuesday statement - issued by foreign affairs but understood to have been a &quot;collective effort&quot; in which Deputy President Thabo Mbeki played a significant role, and ultimately approved by President Nelson Mandela - sought to portray the deal as being in its infancy, saying that a Syrian tender for the tank firing control systems would probably go out only in 1999 or 2000, and that South Africa would have to make a final decision only then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came amid pressure from the United States and renewed reports of tension between Syria and Israel, still a military ally of South Africa. The US is obliged in terms of its own anti-terrorism legislation to reconsider aid to states which sell lethal military equipment to the countries, including Syria, which it brands &quot;state sponsors of terrorism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the statement appeared to contradict other government comments, including one by President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday, confirming that the &quot; conditional&quot; nature of the approval would be reconsidered by cabinet &quot;soon&quot; - according to some officials when the Cabinet meets on January 22. The December 4 decision was reportedly made conditional to allow Mbeki, who was in India at the time, the opportunity to study the implications of approval in terms of US law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also sought to portray the conditional &quot;contracting approval&quot; as a mechanism enabling Denel to market its product in Syria. But experts on South Africa's conventional arms control regime this week pointed out that a contracting permit - which allows South African arms companies to enter contractual negotiations with client states - was the second of three tiers of approval, after the first-tier marketing permit had already been issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice the final tier of approval, that of the export permit, would not be withheld lightly once the contracting permit had been issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the process to have reached the stage of an application for a contracting permit means that talks between Denel and Syria would have reached an advanced stage. A government official has been quoted as saying the request from Syria came in May or June last year. The marketing permit would have been given by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee, chaired by Water and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, as early as the middle of last year. This would have allowed Denel to conduct demonstrations of the arms system to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some, both the Syrian and the earlier Rwandan deal signal an unannounced shift away from South Africa's widely hailed human rights oriented arms control regime. When Essop Pahad, deputy minister in Mbeki's office, told SABC television on Tuesday that South Africa &quot;is not a pacifist country&quot;, it reinforced that view. Insiders say the committee from time to time finds itself deadlocked between the &quot;doves&quot;, including Asmal, and the &quot;hawks&quot;, who include Defence Minister Joe Modise, who tends to defend arms industry interests aggressively. The fact that the committee, in response to Denel's Syria application, referred the matter to Cabinet for a decision may signal that it was trying to absolve itself of a difficult decision after internal disagreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurie Nathan, a member of the government- appointed Cameron Commission probe into arms sales, this week slammed the proposed sale as inconsistent with the government's own policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HUMAN rights groups have criticised Minister of Justice Dullah Omar and Gauteng's Safety and Security MEC Jessie Duarte, for their &quot; knee-jerk&quot; reaction to the public outcry after bail was given to 18-year-old Anwah Philander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both politicians had objected to the granting of bail to the younger brother of entertainer Soli Philander in connection with the rape of two sisters at their home in Observatory, Johannesburg. All charges against Philander were withdrawn on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national outcry over the gang rape, and that of two teenage cousins in Malvern, Johannesburg, led to calls for suspected rapists to be denied bail for a week while police complete their inquiries. Omar and Duarte led the calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We note with deep concern Minister Omar's proposal to amend legislation to compel courts to refuse bail to those accused of serious offences,&quot; said a statement from the Human Rights Committee of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moreover, it is alarming to note that a constitutional amendment may be envisaged to prevent such a law from being struck down as unconstitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham Simpson, director of the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, said Duarte and Omar had responded to public pressure and trial by media. &quot;This case is a classic example of how an innocent person would have been presumed guilty and incarcerated for seven days without the possibility of bail,''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the politicians of ignoring the systemic reasons for rapists being granted bail - such as police not providing adequate information to the courts and magistrates not using powers already enshrined in law to deny bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Attwell, the Witwatersrand deputy attorney general, also questioned the call for bail conditions to be tightened, warning it was likely to cause serious constitutional repercussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar said on Thursday he did not regret the linking of the Philander case to his call for tougher bail conditions. &quot;The rape of these two girls highlighted the tremendous problem rape poses in our society, and it was appropriate that we should respond by indicating the way we are thinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he wasn't sure what evidence the police had against Philander prior to the arrest, nor whether the police should consider apologising. Omar would not apologise. He was also concerned about the growing number of cases were arrests are made, people held, and then charges withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Duarte's said she had acted correctly in light of the evidence given to her by police in objecting to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R5 000 Philander bail. Duarte later retracted her criticism of the magistrate. &quot;I did not know who was involved at the time, but I believe anyone accused of rape or any other serious offence should be held in custody while police carry out their inquiries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 22-year-old Zimbabwean has since been arrested and identified by the rape victims. The Philander family is threatening to sue the police for wrongful arrest, and the media for its reporting. They also claim to have given detectives information which would have led to the arrest of at least two other people connected with both the Malvern and Observatory rapes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The truth commission has released details of the Steyn Report, concealed since 1992 - and it contains startling disclosures.  Stefaans BrUmmer reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORMER state president FW de Klerk entrusted action on the elusive Steyn Report, which linked the apartheid military to &quot;third force&quot; activities, to three top military officials who were themselves implicated - including the present South African National Defence Force chief, General George Meiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission this week released details of the Steyn Report, made to De Klerk in December 1992 by then defence force chief of staff Pierre Steyn. This disclosure settles once and for all that the report in fact contained a written element. De Klerk, who never released details, has told Parliament the report was &quot;verbal&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release may have serious implications for De Klerk, who is now shown to have had knowledge of third force activities - including train violence - almost a year and a half before he relinquished power and arguably handled the information in such a way that a cover-up was facilitated. Train violence continued until the day before the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may also have implications for Meiring, whom the truth commission is eager to question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission announced on Thursday that Steyn, now secretary of defence, briefed commission members on October 10 last year, providing them with a file containing information gathered in his inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included was a &quot;staff report&quot; detailing military components and staff and the unlawful or unauthorised activities Steyn suspected they were involved in.  The commission said Steyn had handed this to De Klerk when he briefed De Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission research director Charles Villa- Vicencio confirmed Steyn's report contained information on train violence by elite reconnaissance unit members of the old South African Defence Force, the involvement of the SADF's 7 Medical Battalion in chemical-biological warfare operations which included the alleged poisoning of state enemies, interference in the political affairs of neighbouring states and homeland coups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also included was information about &quot;a range of suggested criminal activities in relation to drugs, ivory and rhino horn, cycads, fish from Mozambique and the smuggling of arms through the Kruger National Park&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk appointed Steyn to take charge of the SADF's intelligence functions and investigate the Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC), a component of Military Intelligence, after the Goldstone Commission raided DCC's headquarters in November 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Steyn reported back to De Klerk and senior National Party cabinet members a month later, he gave them information on alleged illegal activities by DCC, army intelligence, army operations, some reconnaissance units and 7 Medical Battalion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villa-Vicencio said Steyn's briefing to De Klerk included information that &quot; a number of individuals within these structures had clear influence on the top management of the SADF, thus by implication the SADF itself could be construed to be involved in the creation of violence and intimidation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly Steyn recommended to De Klerk that General Kat Liebenberg, then chief of the SADF, General Meiring, then chief of the Army, and General Joffel van der Westhuizen, then chief of military intelligence, be &quot;asked to take early retirements or forcibly retired if necessary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyn, whose findings were based mostly on intelligence gathered by the then-National Intelligence Service and other agencies, recommended that De Klerk institute a thorough inquiry to substantiate his information. In stead, the three generals Steyn said should go were summoned to Tuynhuis, where De Klerk asked them to draw up a list of military personnel against whom action should be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, De Klerk issued a statement a day later, saying that 23 top SADF officials had been placed on compulsory early retirement or leave. The three generals were not on the list. Nine days later, 15 were reinstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villa-Vicencio said that between January 1993 and August 25 that year Steyn repeatedly made submissions to De Klerk and then-defence minister Kobie Coetzee, expressing concern that further investigations were woefully inadequate. In fact, there were indications that the SADF had embarked on a major cover-up and was destroying documentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth commission deputy chair Alex Boraine this week said it was &quot; extraordinary&quot; that the three generals Steyn wanted investigated had been asked by De Klerk to identify culprits. &quot;It will be very interesting to hear what Mr De Klerk says when he appears again before the commission later this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the implication concerning Meiring was &quot;the most disturbing factor of them all...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a number of really tough probing questions we would like to put to General Meiring concerning the Steyn report, and obviously we will be raising it with the minister of defence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga's cabinet has continued to defy public opinion as well as advice from national transport minister Mac Maharaj and has opted to keep its contentious fleet of new luxury BMWs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ten new BMW 528i92s were ordered for Mpumalanga's MECs in December for R2,3-million, almost immediately after the province announced that severe budget constraints had forced it to cut all new schools, roads and other capital projects in the region. The deal was in direct defiance of advice from Maharaj, who pointed out that the cars cost R77 000 more per car than allowed for by ministerial handbook regulations. The regulations allow MECs to drive cars worth R154 000, while the BMWs cost R232 000 each.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mpumalanga has continued to ignore Maharaj's advice, the province has tried to defuse the budgetary implications of buying the vehicles. A cabinet resolution earlier this month ordered each MECs department and not the province's transport department - to pay for its BMW. Because the transport department is the only department to have budgeted for the vehicles, the move may be construed as unauthorised expenditure by the Auditor General. Mpumalanga's environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi, is the only politician to have refused his new BMW. He told African Eye News Service (South Africa) on Friday that his 1994 issue Mercedes Benz 155 was still good for another 50 000km and that his department was not prepared to &quot;waste&quot; money on vehicles unless absolutely necessary. &quot;I'll only consider trading my Merc in when it gets to 200 000km. I also told the cabinet to go for Mercedes Benz in any case because they hold their market values better over a five year period than the BMW,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkhwanazi has advised his transport counterpart, Jackson Mthembu, to keep the extra BMW for use as a pool vehicle for senior officials and so save on projected expenditure for rental cars. Mthembu declined to comment but his spokesman, Thabo Monareng, confirmed on Saturday that the costs for the luxury fleet had been shifted. He could not say what had prompted the shift or what the budgetary implications for recipient departments would be. Mthembu earlier dismissed Maharaj's call for MECs to follow his lead and drive cheaper cars as impractical and &quot;out of touch&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Mpumalanga's geographic size and poor road system demanded better performing vehicles and that the BMW had been &quot;scientifically&quot; proven to be the best for the job. Minister Maharaj drives a 1992 Volkswagen Jetta. Mpumalanga finance MEC, Jacques Modipane, also refused to comment on the issue other than to confirm that he was keeping his BMW and that his department would be paying for it. Modipane previously accused reporters of racism for questioning the deal and insisted that he had a &quot;certain&quot; status in his community as a political leader and could therefore not be expected to drive a smaller vehicle. - African Eye News Service (South Africa)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's stock exchange started the week quieter Monday, with the watershed Industrial Index shedding 273 points to close trading at 10,018.4 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The index, which last week broke through the 10,000-point barrier for the first time in its 51-year history, was, however, very active, with reasonable turnovers in several counters, among them the construction group, Gullivers and the trading-to-manufacturing conglomerate, Mashonaland Holdings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counters to lose included the transport group, Clan, the trading firm, Tedco, as well as the tobacco trading combine, TSL Ltd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most expensive counters to lose were, blue-chip Delta Corporation, and the merchant bank, FMB, which each shed 100 cents to 44 zimdollars (4.4 U.S. dollars) and 60 zimdollars (6.0 U.S. dollars), respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was in response to profit taking by investors who had gone on a buying frenzy during the beginning of January, sending the Industrial Index to new heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reports of inflation falling to an annualized figures of 16.4 percent in December 1996, and interest rates softening further, analysts are expecting active trading on the local bourse during the next few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors have also been cheered by reports that the country will experience an agriculture-led growth of between 6 percent and seven percent in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Mining Index lost 25 points Monday to close at 1,091.2 points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - A major African adolescent reproductive health forum began Monday with an appeal for a solution to the gender-based problems afflicting women and youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the forum, Ethiopia's social affairs minister, Kebede Tedesse, told the 300 delegates that currently such problems are blamed for the loss of 36 percent of the healthy years of life among women of reproductive age and 12 percent of men.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned these problems to be unregulated fertility, maternal mortality and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the participants to find solutions within the continent's social realities, to ensure that &quot;future generations of African population will live in an environment that is less oppressive and unjust to women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he warned that government and other actors also needed to solve other related cultural, traditional and socio-economic problems of education, employment, living conditions, family education and gender relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the forum's organizers, Perry Curlin of the Washington-based Center for Development and Population Activities, told PANA Sunday that she hoped the meeting would come out with concrete solutions to the plight of sub- Saharan women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thrust of the four-day forum, being co-organized by the United Nations Population Fund, is to reverse the trend under which at least 50 percent or more of young sub-Saharan women give birth before the age of 20 years.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's proposed 650-million-U.S.  -dollar arms deal with Syria is only at a tentative stage, although the government is in favor of the transaction in principle, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that South African armaments company, Denel, had been issued with a marketing licence in Syria, following a Syrian request for tank firing systems. But, a tendering system of up to three years was involved, he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki was speaking at Midrand, near Johannesburg, at the conclusion of a four-day meeting of the African National Congress hierarchy to discuss policy matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of the proposed supply of arms to Syria, he said, fell within the ambit of Pretoria's clear policy on arms sales abroad. Criteria included the human rights record of the country concerned, the likelihood that the weapons concerned would be used to suppress the local population, and whether or not a United Nations arms embargo was in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Foreign Affairs spokesman explained that once the contractual stage of negotiation was reached in about two years time, it would be necessary for South Africa to review the situation in the Middle East and decide whether or not to go ahead with the Syrian arms deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't pursue an apartheid policy in terms of our foreign relations in the Middle East,&quot; Mbeki said. &quot;We don't follow a policy in the Middle East such as the policy that was followed by the previous regime, which was to form an alliance with Israel and be hostile to the rest of the countries in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the United States was being hypocritical in opposing the proposed sale of South African tank-gun aiming equipment to Syria. The U.S.  threatened last week to suspend aid to South Africa if the Syrian arms deal went ahead. &quot;U.S. equipment is being marketed in Syria for precisely the same thing,&quot; he added, &quot;and the U.S. government has let that be because they understand precisely what is happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African cabinet is scheduled to discuss the Syrian arms deal at its first regular meeting of the year on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cache, in the locality of Machahomo, contained 2,000 rounds of various types of ammunition, 77 AK-47 assault rifles, 34 hand grenades, three mortar barrels and seven rocket propelled grenade launchers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Armenio Panguene said local residents reported the location of the arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said there was still a lot of weaponry hidden in the province, following the end of the 16-years civil war that was supported, on the rebel side, by apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panguene said that it was important to destroy the arms caches because the provided ready supplies for gangs of armed robbers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that the establishment of an African Peace-keeping Force would help strengthen the continent's capacity to deal with its crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan, 58, said told the Pan African News Ageny correspondent at the U.N.  that the establishment of this force was particularly important in an era when peacekeeping operations were taking on a regional dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that though the peacekeeping operations in Cambodia and Bosnia were U.N. missions, Asian and European countries, respectively, played a major role. &quot;I think it is normal that Africa should also develop capability to be able to either do it themselves or join in with others to solve some of the problems on the continent,&quot; he said Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though a United States proposal, in 1996, for the establshment of an African Crisis Response Force elicited mixed reactions from African leaders, Annan said it was a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the U.S. proposal is a helpful one,&quot; he said. &quot;The proposal has been refined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the proposal, which is still under consideration, nations would earmark military units to be trained and prepared for peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The units, which will also be given logistic support and training, could form part of an African force or part of a U.N. peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Annan, who until his election as secretary-general was the U.N.  under secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, said that the U.N. may increase its activities in Somalia and Liberia to help bring those war-torn countries back to normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Somalia, he said that the world body, which he said was active on the humanitarian side, might become more actively re-engaged on the political front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an office in Nairobi which is still working on the Somali crisis and a group of ambassadors here in New York have formed Friends of Somalia, a group trying to explore what can be done (about the situation there),&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Liberia, Annan said the U.N. was in the process of increasing the number of its observers in the country while also becoming engaged in its electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of now, we have either doubled or we are about to double our observers in Liberia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of November 1996, the U.N. had 23 military observers to that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Lansana kouyate was is in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, discussing with the Liberian situation with President Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to Africa's economic problems, he said &quot;a fresh strategy&quot; was needed to stimulate private foreign investments in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot as Africans and the U.N. chase continuously diminishing donor dollars,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to adapt to the realities of the world economy today, and find ways and means of working with the private sector, ensuring of course that they do not dominate some of the smaller countries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed support for the U.N. Special Initiative on Africa, launched in 1996 by his predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically, if we accept that 80 per cent of international (financial) flows are in the hands of multinationals,...if we are going to assist developing countries, whether in Africa or Asia, we need to find ways of tapping into the capabilities of the multinationals,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that Africa countries must first create political stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, first priority will be for us to settle the problems we have, whether in eastern Zaire, in the Great Lakes region, or in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should also try and respect the rights of our people and push democratization, to open up the society politically and free up the economies for people to use their initiative and energies to help develop their countries,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Statement issued by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns January 15 about arrests of opposition leaders in Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is deeply concerned about the arrest and imprisonment yesterday of opposition party leaders Mahamane Ousmane, Mahamadou Issoufou, and Tanja Mamadou and the announced use of a special tribunal by the government to deal with political crimes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. calls on the government of Niger to ensure the safety and well-being of all those in detention and to conduct any judicial proceedings openly and in a manner that is fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This latest repression of the peaceful political opposition clearly demonstrates the regime's continued determination to thwart democracy and basic human rights. This is another deplorable step in the wake of the military's seizure of power a year ago and its conduct of fraudulent Presidential elections in July. These actions inevitably undermine international confidence in Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has repeatedly expressed its concern about the economic ramifications of Niger's political situation. The United States terminated its assistance program to Niger in response to last year's coup. Political change, including early restoration of democracy and respect for basic human rights, is critical to Niger's political development and economic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States again calls on Niger's regime to institute an early return to civilian, democratic government and to respect the rights of its people in the interests of Niger, its economic well-being, and its future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said the airlines has also a plan to add to its fleet big aircraft which can accommodate simultaneously many passengers and large quantity of cargo as the capacity of the existing B757 aircraft is low.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - Some Somali refugees residing here in the capital underlined the importance of tolerance, mutual trust and confidence among the 26 political parties which recently formed the National Salvation Council (NSC toward entering sustainable peace in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees approached by ENA reporters in connection with the formation of the NSC said peace will be a reality if ass parties are determined to jointly work for the reconstruction of Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abduwehab Hassen who said he is still in the dark about the whereabouts of his wife lost in the civil strife in Somalia, said he is confident that the political movements could achieve the goals they have set provided they implement the consensus reached upon returning to Somalia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expresses conviction if the 26 political parties remain united for the cause of peace, both Mohammed Igal of North Somalia and Hussen Aideed who did not take part in the peace deal will follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former businessman who had been here for the past one and a half year expressed his belief that the international community will extend its support to the NSC if the political parties work in unison to promote peace and stability in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kedija Yesuf, a refugee living here with her four children told the journalists that Somalis are the ones responsible to come up with lasting solution to their own problems and she is eager to return to her homeland if the NSC succeeds in bringing about peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens could not lead a peaceful life without the installation of a legal government, she said, and expressed her conviction that the future will be bright with the civil strife halted and an independent government put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yusuf Shersi, 60, said the Ethiopia government and the public at large, as they are well informed about the plight of the Somali people should consolidate efforts they have been exerting to restore peace and stability in Somalia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - Some elders have expressed grave concern over the recent trend of inciting organized disturbances within church precincts here during prayer services which the Secretary of the Holy Synod described ad &quot;the first ever scandalous act in the 2000-year history of the EOC,&quot; Representatives of the group behind the commotion have meanwhile said that they would press ahead till their demands are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approached by journalists here on Wednesday, Fitawrari Negash Worku said: &quot; Act of violence such as that witnessed at the St. Stephen's Church on January 9 was disgraceful in a country noted for its long history of religious tolerance and forbearance.&quot; Another elder, Ato Gena Desta, stated that he was very much saddened to learn of such unseemly behaviour at a place of worship.  The two people feared eventual church-laity disunity if the trend is allowed to run its course.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary of the Holy Synod, His Grace Abune Gerima, said that the Questions which the group which illegally organized itself under &quot; Mahberehawariyat&quot; raised were mere rumour and described the means employed to get their voice heard as quite simply horrendous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that contrary to EOC procedures, the so-called opposition group named itself the law maker and tried to impose its &quot;strictures&quot; on the Holy Synod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the demands of the self-styled &quot;Maherehawariyat&quot; included: Alleged maladministration and nepotism within the EOC be immediately ended; hemits be allowed to preach in any sanctuary in the metropolis; the patriarch should be accountable to the Holy Synod and not vice versa; the church establishment admit that electing a new patriarch while his predecessor is alive is against the law of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They brought these and similar other questions to my office and, after scrutinising each, I told them that they were all fabrications and not-worth presenting to the Holy Synod,&quot; said Abune Gerima, adding that they ultimately resorted to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to His Grace, religion was only a cover-up and the motive behind their acts was something else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The surprising thing is that some of the people opposed to the appointment of Abune Paulos and claiming that the Holy Synod is accountable to the patriarch are the very ones who endorsed his holiness's assumption of office by their signature and who very well know that he is accountable to the Holy Synod.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melake Selam T/medhin G/Selassie, administrator of the St.Stephen's Church, Lique Tebebet Taddese Wube, who was with the patriarch when the attempt on the latter's life was made, as well as Deacon Alemseged Wosene, who got his left hand stabbed in the fracas, all said that while religious service was going on there some people shouted &quot;We've got questions&quot; from the right side.  The assailant meanwhile came from the left side waving his meter-long sword, aimed it at the Patriarch's head but fell on the ground for he lost his balance. They said that on a second attempt, the assailant was shot dead from a distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two policemen on duty said that members of the said group were hurling an avalanche of stones to where His Holiness the Patriarch was seated, and many apparently confused laity were running for cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of &quot;Mahberehawariyat&quot; said, on the other hand, that reinstatement of some clergymen who have been dismissed and allowing hermits to preach at any church will settle the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aba Afework Mersa, who claimed to have been an administrator of a sanctuary in Wollo and who said he was fired from his post by the personal order of the Patriarch, said that he joined the group to seek reinstatement. Asked if the association they formed has a legal status, he said it was the democratic right of every citizen to form any such society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another interviewee, Hermit Gebre-Mariam Gebeyehu, said that to be allowed to preach in any church remains his critical demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Grace Abune Gerima said earlier that for any clergyman to be allowed to preach, he must first be certified of his competence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesfaye Wondimu, who this reporter very well knows to be one of the scoundrels and drunkards in the metropolis, is also a member of the association. He accuses the patriarch of introducing &quot; a Roman Catholic doctrine&quot; in to the EOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mahberehawariyat&quot; was founded by 15 members, including a retired colonel, and is chaired by Hermit G/Meskel H/Meskel who was once accused of inciting similar disturbances in and around churches in the the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During talks yesterday with the departing Ambassador of Lesotho, J.T.  Mestings, who took leave of him at the end of his tour of duty in Ethiopia, President Negasso said the instability in the Sudan is the creation of the Sudanese government which failed to pay due attention to efforts being exerted by member countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) including Ethiopia to peacefully solve the problem in that country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provocative activities by the Sudanese governmental aimed at establizing neighbouring countries, urging and organizing extremist Islamist groups as is evident now, are not expected of a neighbouring country, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs quoted Dr. Negasso as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said Sudan is engaged in disrupting peace in neighbouring countries including Ethiopia, at a time when Ethiopia is striving to do everything in her capacity to defuse the conflict in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Negasso said instability in neighbouring countries has a negative effect be it directly or indirectly and subsequently, Ethiopia has continued in its efforts to bring about peace in the Sudan and other countries in Africa, according to the spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said Ethiopia is bracing to export certain types of grains abroad as the country's food self-sufficiency programme has born fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Mestings on his part said that he was impressed by Ethiopia's economic achievements in the last five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassador commended measures the Ethiopian government has taken to seeking peaceful solutions to political problems in Somalia and countries of the Great Lakes Region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) yesterday said that the amount of credit development agencies receive has increased as the government began reducing its domestic debts since the introduction of market economy in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Yohannes Ayalew, a senior research officer in the economic research department of the bank, told ENA that the amount of credit given last year to development agencies mainly to the private sector had increased because the government managed to reduce its debt by 2 billion birr last year from the total package of 9.8 billion birr registered a year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, the credit the private sector received in 1983 E.C., that is before the economic reform, was 391.6 million birr, adding that the amount offered for a similar purpose in 1988 had reached 5.4 billion birr owning the reduction of government domestic debts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why the rise in the amount of credit does not entail inflation, Ato Yohannes said inflation was minimized because the increase in the fund set aside for credit is below the economic development and the reduction in government domestic debts decreased the amount of money in circulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The credit policy of the country was prepared in such a way that it could go along with the new market economy, discouraging credit discrimination prevalent during the previous command economic policy and normalising the credit rate with the rate of inflation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the purpose of the policy includes the transfer of credit the government used to take for non-profit-making activities for the benefit of the privet ctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research of said government intervention in providing credit services is now avoided and the 3 percent interest rate the government used to pay previously is also decided to be determined by the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether or not the similarity in the interest rate for all economic sectors could affect the agricultural sector, he said the low interest rate state farms and co-operatives' used to enjoy was loss incurring, adding that it would be possible to allocate the limited credit resource to fruitful sectors only when a similar interest rate is enforced in all the economic sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the enforcement of the economic reform programme the government's domestic debt was 8.9 percent of the gross domestic product. However, the percentage dropped to only 1.9 in 1986 E.C., the research officer explained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The Speaker of the House of Peoples Representatives, Ato Dawit Yohannes, yesterday commended the overall working procedures of the Region 14 Prison Administration saying: &quot;The management and staff of the prison service are doing everything to ensure that the rights of prisoners are respected in accordance with the dictates of the constitution FDRE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a remark that was made after visiting the ins and outs of the Region 14 Central Prison together with members of the House sub-committee responsible for police and prisons, women's' affairs and legal matters. Ato Dawit said that though it can't be said that there are no problems or difficulties in the activities of the prison, there is every reason to believe that the administration has done its best to cater to the rights of the inmates in accordance with the country's capacity to provide the necessary inputs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The half-day visit by the Mps was intended to get first-hand information about and personally observe the conditions of the prison and find out whether things are going smoothly there, or as one of them put it, &quot;to see whether the articles of the constitution which provide for the protection of the human rights of prisoners or those stipulated by international laws with respect to the same are implemented in the proper manner.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was noted that this practice of getting eye-witness accounts of the performances of different executing agencies by Mps are a marked departure from the familiar one of hearing reports from executives of agencies and will continue to be put into effect at different times. Each and every executing agency will henceforth be falling under close scrutiny, one deputy said. Far from being able to get in touch with the real feelings and interests of the general mass of people benefiting from these agencies, this close following by Mps will made the executive agencies accomplish their tasks with utmost energy and honest, it was noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On arrival at the central prison, the deputies first listened to the head of the Central Prison Bureau, Ato Seifu Ahmed, who said that the facility suffered huge property losses and lootings at the collapse of the Derg but has then been taking all measures to not only rehabilitate itself in material services but also reorganize its staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that various changes have been made, especially since the last two years, to improve the living conditions of the prisoners and that the effort in this regard will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visitors were also briefed about the general picture of the prison by two managerial staff of the prison who spoke of the &quot;relatively&quot; comfortable living conditions the inmates are now leading as compared with the past.  While most prisoners slept on rags of their own in the past, they are now provided with sponge mattresses. They also noted that health, education and other facilities were made available to prisoners, though not up to adequate standards, and special attention was paid to women prisoners. The deputies later posed various questions to the staff and were given due explanations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mps then toured nearly all sections of the prison, visited with admiration different wood products and artistic works produced by the prisoners and also spoke with them about their conditions in the prison .  Most prisoners said they were &quot;confortable&quot; with the conditions but appealed to the government to provide more support for the self help projects they undertake so that more prisoners will participate and acquire new skills either in handicrafts or other fields of work so as to be self-supporting citizens when they end their period of internment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company to set up 150 min birr factory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Ethiopia Maize and Agro-industry Company, a private venture, announced that it has completed a study to set up a factory producing raw materials for the processing of sweets, drinks, textiles, medicines and edible oil from maize with a capital close to 150 million birr.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit service grows as gov't domestic debt decreases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) yesterday said that the amount of credit development agencies receive has increased as the government began reducing its domestic debts since the introduction of market economy in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Yohannes Ayalew, a senior research officer in the economic research department of the bank, told ENA that the amount of credit given last year to development agencies mainly to the private sector had increased because the government managed to reduce its debt by 2 billion birr last year from the total package of 9.8 billion birr registered a year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, the credit the private sector received in 1983 E.C., that is before the economic reform, was 391.6 million birr, adding that the amount offered for a similar purpose in 1988 had reached 5.4 billion birr owning the reduction of government domestic debts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The extremist government of the National Islamic Front (NIF) in Khartoum has been a major obstacle to implementing Ethiopia's foreign policy which takes the promotion of good neighbourliness has one of its prominent objectives. Minister of Foreign Affairs of the FDRE said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a seminar convened here to discuss Ethiopia's new foreign policy, Ato Seyoum Mesfin said Ethiopia has tried its best to ward off infiltrates and teach a lesson the NIF administration which has consistently been engaged in provocative activities against Ethiopia by urging and organizing anti-peace elements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One notable testimony to the unfriendly activities of the Sudanese authorities against Ethiopia, the minister recalled, is the assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Addis Ababa by a group backed by the NIF administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia has consistently lobbied urging the United Nations and the OAU to take proper action that the crime calls for, Ato Seyoum noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the case is still on the agenda of the Security Council, Ato Seyoum said that the manner in which it is being handled has not so far made Sudan abide by international laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NIF administration has in fact intensified its destabilizing activities in the region and is urging for a jihad on Ethiopia and other countries, the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that member states of the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) must not let Sudan's unbecoming engagements hamper their activities,.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia is expected to give all the necessary support to IGAD's initiatives to bring about lasting peace in Sudan, said the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to Ethiopia's foreign relations, Ato Seyoum said Ethiopia has successfully consolidated her ties with neighbouring countries despite the obstacles from the Sudanese side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the continental level and beyond, the nation has won the friendship of many countries and development partners in the process, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has also honoured her commitment to Africa, one instance being the dispatching of a contingent of her army to Rwanda to ensure peace in that country, he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Seyoum, however, noted that inspite of improved relations with Kuwait and Qatar, the task of consolidating ties with the Gulf countries leaves a lot to be desired.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - After six years of fratricidal war and immense blood-shed which failed to yield to repeated arbitration from both the continental and the world bodies, faction leaders of war-torn Somalia now seem to have realised beyond any doubt that the key to the normalisation's of situations in their country is within their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formation, recently, of the National Salvation Council (NSC following an intensive High Level Consultation at Sodere is a clear indication of their determination to relieve the sufferings of their people and to once again reconstitute the country into a functioning nation.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after the signing of the historic agreement, the five co- chairmen of the 41 member Council met the local press and correspondents at the Ghion Hotel on 6 January, during which they answered to a number of questions on various issues, including the sustainability of the agreement.  following is the full text of the press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- Since the inauguration of the NSC there have been hostile reactions in Somalia against your agreement, particularly from Hussein Ideed's group and Al-Itihad. What will be your response?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- It is not surprising to hear such a reaction from Hussein Idded.  He was invited like any other faction leader to join us in the High Level Consultation so that we can together promote the cause of peace in Somalia, but refused. But we still hope that he will cone day reconsider his present stand and join the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- Any guarantee that your agreements now will not fail as was the case in the past?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- In the past it was not uncommon to see us disperse after agreements were signed. Now, things are very different. Our people are tired of war and blood-shed. They need peace. They want to lead a new life. And we are here to reflect their wishes and aspirations. And unlike in the past, we not only signed the agreement but worked out a detailed strategy of implementation as well. as to our determination, you can read if from our faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- A member of the Al-Itihad military command said in Mogadishu that Al-Itihad would not recognise and agreement that does not include the values of Islam. Would you kindly comment on this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- We don't want Al-Itihad to recognise us. We even doubt its very existence; we don't recognise it as a legal organisation at all. We only know that Al-Itihad is a terrorist gang who wants to reimmerse Somalia in a new form of blood-shed and to destabilise the entire region in the name of Islam.  But the fact remains that the Somali people are 100% Muslims and they don't want a new Messiah to bring the message. We know the teachings of Islam. It accepts neither violence nor the use of instruments of coercion. So we Strongly warn Al-Itihad and the countries behind its disruptive actions to refrain from destabilising the region. What we have achieved so far and the realisation of our declaration entirely depend on the will of our people, not on Al-Itihad's good will. And we are confident that we have got the trust of the majority of the Somali people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- do you think Al-Itihad is a Somali organisation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- We truly believe that Al-Itihad's actions are being directed by foreign countries. Though we don't feel appropriate to mention their names now, one day we will talk face to face with the countries involved. We have got evidences proving their backing to Al-Itihad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- What is the position of the factions represented in the NSC as regards Ethiopia's military action against Al-Itihad both in its own soil and across border?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- We are completely against any kind of military confrontation which jeopardises the security of the region. We are for the sovereignty and security of Somalia and we will never encourage any country to violate our sovereignty. but we also recognise that every nation has got the right to defend itself whenever its internal security and stability are jeopardised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- Some factions represented in the council have been accused of allegedly receiving arms from Ethiopia. Is it true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- It is not all true that Ethiopia has ever supplied military hardware to any of the factions represented here. The allegation is not only baseless but also has an ulterior motive to divert the attention of the world from the main issue of national reconciliation which we have embarked on.  Ethiopia is committed to help the Somalis regain peace and cannot be a promoter of conflict in any way. It has, since 1992, been exerting tireless efforts to help bring peace and reconciliation in Somalia. In Somalia, as you know, we have got an arsenal that could last, say for 10 years hence. We need someone to disarm us. Those who have been spreading this and other unsubstantiated allegations are the same people who rebuffed the call to participate in the efforts underway for peace and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- Could you give an overview of your main tasks during your 6- month term of office?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- The tasks ahead are serious and challenging ones. They are numerous that we cannot list them all now. But the main ones include: drafting a transitional national charter which will serve as the basic constitutional document throughout the transitional period, installing transitional government representing all the Somali people, work for the restoration of peace and stability in areas where conflicts still prevail, and eventually embark on inter-clan and inter-community reconciliation among our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- In case you fail to achieve your objectives by employing peaceful means and if Husein Ideed launches an attack against one of the factions represented in the council, would you resort to military action?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- We are peace-oriented, basically. It's not in our plan to use military action as a means of realising the provisions of our agreement. We will employ or deploy peaceful means and dialogue to settle outstanding political differences. But this council is today a national institution which unifies most of the political movements in the country which represent the majority of the Somali people. An attack against any of the factions under the umbrella of the NSC means an attack against the entire institution, and the answer will be collective self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- Can we take for granted that the council will be the legitimate representative of the people of Somalia in future continental as well as international meetings and conferences?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- Yes, we very much hope so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- what will the NSC's relations with the Arab world like?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- We are Muslims, we are a member of the Arab League, so we have traditional, religious and historical ties with the Arab world. During the past 6 years of civil strife in our country, the contribution of the Arab world has been far less than that we expected of it. And we don't know why this happened. But we still hope that that part of the world in particular will greatly contribute toward the reconstruction of Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- What will be the function of the office that you are going to open in Addis Ababa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- The office we are going to open in Addis Ababa will be an extension of our headquarters in Mogadishu and will have a Liaison character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:- Is your council a clan based institution or one based on political views?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:- We are political movements and we are clan based movements.  Accepting our realities, we have used both the political instrument and the clan instrument to achieve our goal. In the past, we used to be clan- sensitive. But the realities today have taught us and compelled us to devise a way to merge the two together so that they can be viable instruments for political end.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The revitalised Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) has presented 17 development project proposals to donor countries with a view to improving the economic conditions of members states, senior expert in the Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Moges Belayneh said the project proposals prepared by IGAD focus on the expansion of infrastructures, food self-sufficiency, environmental protection and conflict resolution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposals have enjoyed the approval of donor countries, he said, adding implementation studies are being carried out by agencies of donor states.  About 15 of the total projects will directly benefit Ethiopia, the expert added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projects prepared by IGAD, which revitalised itself earlier include the construction of asphalt roads linking Gondar, Humera Barentu and Gedarit, renovation of the Ethio-Djibouti railway stations, as well as the expansion of telephone service in Addis Ababa, Dessie, Assab, Djibouti, Berahera, And Hargesa, Ato Moges said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the expert, the execution of projects will be mostly financed by donor states and to this end heads of agencies of donor countries have begun discussing policy issues with officials in the IGAD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the construction of roads and the installation of railway tracks could begin very soon through the European Union while other projects are waiting the completion of implementation studies being carried out by donor countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Member states of IGAD are Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya Somalia, Sudan and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authority was revitalised in 1995 in such a way that it could bring about positive changes in promoting sustainable development and economic co- operation among member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IGAD was first established in 1986 by Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Djibouti and Kenya mainly to address problems related to drought and aridity, Ato Moges recalled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The Ethiopian Somali Democratic League (ESDL) and the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) have agreed to convene a Somali National Congress (SNC) with the objective of forming &quot;a single democratic organisation that will assume the mandate of the political guidance and will work toward the fulfilment of the political, economic, and social objectives of Ethiopian Somali&quot;, a joint statement issued at the Ghion Hotel here yesterday said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday reminded the Sudanese government that no useful purpose would be served by striving to &quot; externalise&quot; its internal military debacle for which Ethiopia has absolutely no responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement it issued in connection with Sudan's allegation that Ethiopia has shelled its two border towns the ministry said: &quot;It is time for Sudan to realize that it cannot always succeed to fool others believing that fabrications accompanied with great fanfare would be given the benefit of the doubt and some credence by the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement sited the call by the Sudanese government for general mobilisation and for jihad. &quot;accompanied with the beating of the drums of war&quot; following the reported take-over of Kurmuk by the Sudan People's Liberation Army as the latest futile attempt to shift responsibility onto others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry said an alibi is being sought by Khartum by accusing Ethiopia of involvement in military activities against Sudanese troops as often happens when the National Islamic Front suffers military defeat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such accusations were evident in the past two years, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one who has closely followed the activities in foreign policy of the new Ethiopia can doubt the deep commitment of the country and its peoples to live in peace with its neighbours, including with the Sudan, the statement noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, despite frustrations encountered so far, will continue, along with other members of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), to do whatever is practically possible to help in the resolution of the crisis in the Sudan, the ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is the full text of the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one who has followed closely the activities in foreign policy of the new Ethiopia and of the Federal Democratic Republic can doubt the deep commitment of the country and its peoples to live in peace with its neighbours, including with the Sudan. Nor can it be neglected, including by Sudanese authorities, that Ethiopia has made all the necessary effort, within the framework of IGA, to assist in the search for peace in the Sudan. Despite the frustrations encountered so far, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia will continue, alone with other members of IGAD, to do whatever is practically possible to help in the resolution of the crisis in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand, it has also been obvious to all those who follow developments in our sub-region that the Sudanese authorities have shown little respect, not only to their own people, bus also to their neighbours, including to Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often this has been reflected in the most blatant forms of acts of destabilisation and betrayal of friend-ship and trust, one instance of which is still before the Security Council, Another time the insanity in Khartoum takes the from a call for Jihad against its neighbours, the latest example of which was a declaration issued by the representative of the Sudanese government in Mogadishu calling for jihad against Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have still been other occasions when the Sudanese authorities have deemed it useful to ascribe to others responsibilities for their domestic problems or for their military setbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest such attempt to shift responsibility onto others by Sudanese authorities which is also accompanied with the beating of the drums of war, with a call for general mobilisation and for jihad has taken place on 5 January, 1997, following the reported take-over of Kurmuk by the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army. As often happens when the National Islamic Front suffers military defeat, an alibi is being sought by Kahrtoum by accusing Ethiopia of involvement in military activities against, Sudanese troops. It is to be expected that this accusation would be taken by the National Islamic Front government to the Security Council with the additional aim of diverting the attention of the council from the unfinished business before it inconnection with a proven case of state sponsored terrorism and an assassination attempt by Sudanese authorities against a head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time of the release of this press statement the sabre rattling was continuing in Khartoum and the National Islamic front authorities were feverishly trying to convince the Sudanese people and the international community that their apparent military debacle was of Ethiopia's making. No one knows better than the Sudanese authorities themselves that the accusation has no bases and that Ethiopia has no hand in what is obviously a military setback suffered by the authorities in Kartoum. It is to be noted that this is not the first time that Sudanese accusatory finger was pointed at Ethiopia over the past two years whenever similar military defeats have been suffered by Sudanese authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia wishes to remind the Sudanese authorities that no useful purpose would be served by striving to externalise what they know too well is an internal military debacle for which Ethiopia has absolutely no responsibility.  It is time for the Sudanese authorities to realise that they cannot always succeed to fool others, and to dustup believing that fabrications accompanied with great fanfare would be given the benefit of the doubt and some credence by the international community. This would only hurt the Sudan and nor would it be in the interest of peace in our subregion&quot;.</SPAN></P>

Evoking the liberation in 1991 of hundreds of &quot; disappeared&quot; people who had been held in secret detention centers for more than a decade, the organization believes that Baba ould Ahmed ould Abderrahman may also be held in a secret detention center and asks for his immediate liberation, unless he is charged with a recognizably criminal offense.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Questionned about the aims of his visit, Mr. Sayed answers that the first goal is to look for support in this delicate stage of the beginning negociations with Morocco, particularly to find mediators and a neutral place for the meetings. He adds that the Sahrawis put great trust in Switzerland, they know for its neutrality and tradition of mediation, and he recalls that the commitment of Ambassador Manz and the work of the Swiss Medical Unit in Western Sahara after the cease-fire have been very appreciated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Report by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights: &quot; Beset by Contradictions: Islamization, Legal Reform and Human Rights in Sudan,&quot; December, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This report analyzes the impact of the Sudanese government's imposition of Islamic law on the country's criminal justice system, and evaluates the extent to which Islamization has affected Sudan's compliance with its international human rights obligations. It finds that many abuses in Sudan are not directly related to the government's Islamist ideology, but follow patterns common to many types of governments. This case study addresses a broader international debate about the impact of Islamic political movements on human rights protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. Legal History</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islam has been an enduring element in the history, politics, and law of Sudan for centuries. From the Mahdist uprising against British rule in 1884 to the present, Islamists have protested the marginalization of Islamic law and the predominance of foreign legal codes, including Ottoman and British law. Under British colonial rule, the common law system became firmly entrenched while Islam was confined to matters of personal law. This legal structure persisted through the end of colonial rule into Sudanese independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the post-Independence period, the National Islamic Front (NIF) developed into an important movement that appealed to those Sudanese disillusioned by the traditional Muslim sects. To counteract the growing power of the NIF, then President Colonel Jaafer Numeiri (1969-1985) declared his renewed Islamic orientation. To bring the legal system into conformity with Islamic law, Numeiri introduced sweeping legal changes. Numeiri angered citizens and legal professionals by applying the new Islamic provisions, known as the September Laws, in an arbitrary and repressive manner. Mounting criticism of Numeiri's rule led to a popular uprising in 1985 that deposed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese lawyers and judges often criticized the undemocratic practices of the Numeiri government, protesting infringements on the rule of law and advocating for legal reform, thus making them targets for persecution and harassment. Neither the transitional military government (1985) nor the elected civilian government of Sadiq al-Mahdi had the will or the capability to repeal the September Laws. This testified to the growing importance on the national political scene of the National Islamic Front (NIF), which continues to play an integral role in the current government of Lieutenant-Colonel al- Bashir. As such, the NIF must be considered in any analysis of the government's Islamization program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. The Role of the National Islamic Front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Islamic Front (NIF) is part of a global phenomenon of Islamic revivalism throughout the Middle East, North Africa and beyond. It is an ideological movement seeking comprehensive reform of Muslim society. For the NIF, faith is not confined to the arena of individual morality, but is also integral to the conduct of social, economic and political relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first years of the regime were characterized by gross human rights violations of a kind common to secular regimes worldwide, such as extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, torture, unfair trial procedures and repressive security measures. The situation has not remained static, however, and these brutal governmental tactics have largely given way to more subtle methods of social control such as restrictions on the right to freedom of expression, opinion, religion, association and movement. The Sudanese government has criminalized political and ideological dissent, engages a multi-faceted security apparatus, and has installed a system of rewards and punishments based on adherence to governmental policies and observance of government-approved Islamic practices. Though less conspicuous than mass arrests and summary executions, these control mechanisms are equally debilitating to the fundamental freedoms of Sudanese citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. Structure of the Judiciary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive control over the judiciary and the conduct of the courts has seriously compromised the rule of law in Sudan. This control is exercised within the framework of repressive emergency regulations imposed by Bashir's military regime in the aftermath of the coup. The lack of a constitution, the unchecked powers of the security services and political manipulation of the court system are elements of a parallel system of justice that can be invoked by the government, when it deems expedient, to deal with acts of political opposition and threats - real or imagined - to the security of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. Independence and Quality of the Legal Profession and Judiciary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government harassment of lawyers and judges poses one of the most serious threats to the rule of law in Sudan. In the aftermath of the coup, members of the legal profession were detained along with the political opposition and held without charge or trial for months and in some cases for years. The previously independent Sudan Bar Association was taken over by a government- appointed steering committee and was subjected to the same restrictive regulations as trade unions. The RCC purged the bench and dismissed or voluntarily retired hundreds of judges. These judges have been largely replaced by those sympathetic to the regime, resulting in the under representation of women and Christian southerners on the bench. The fact that half of the current total number of judges have been replaced since 1989 is the primary cause of deterioration in the quality and competence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VI. Islamic Criminal Justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to establish its legitimacy as an Islamic government, the Bashir regime must be seen to be implementing Islamic law. However, the Sudanese legal system is based on several sources of law in addition to Shari'a, including common law, customary law, and international treaty law. The presence of these other legal frameworks challenges the exclusivity of Shari'a. To resolve these apparent contradictions, the Sudanese government articulates a compromise position that embraces Sudan's obligations under international and other sources of law as long as they do not overstep the boundaries of Shari'a. The resulting tensions between different legal principles lead to inconsistencies in the theory and practice of Sudanese criminal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Sudanese officials support the position that Sudan s obligations under international law should be reviewed in light of the government's renewed emphasis on Islamic law. Yet other officials, including the Chief Justice, continue to affirm Sudan's compliance with international standards. In order to maintain the consistency of its Islamic approach, the government selectively challenges those of its obligations under international human rights treaties that appear to contradict Shari'a.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lawyers Committee believes that the Sudanese people must be free to live in the social system of their choice. This freedom, however, must be balanced with Sudan's obligations to uphold international human rights standards aimed at individuals. To date, the Sudanese government has failed in several respects to implement international standards within domestic law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese penal legislation does not accurately reflect Sudan s obligations under Article 7 of the ICCPR which protects individuals from cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. Primarily, the inclusion of punishments such as flogging, stoning and mutilations (amputations, qisas) is in contravention of this Article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conduct of Public Order Courts, created to deal with petty infractions of Islamic law (IE improper dress, alcohol violations), fails to satisfy the minimum standards for a fair trial. These courts are characterized by rapidity of judgment, political dependence, incompetence of judges, irregularity of trial procedures and the absence of safeguards against abuse.  Procedures contained in the Criminal Code are replaced with summary procedures, and execution of the sentence, particularly sentences of flogging, are carried out almost immediately without chance for appeal. A large percentage of Public Order court defendants are non-Muslim women from displacement camps around Khartoum, raising the issue of equality before the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese government has dealt with the issue of discrimination against women and non-Muslims by using a variety of de facto discriminatory practices to undermine de jure provisions of equality. Such practices include punishing non-Muslims for offenses defined in the Shari'a, such as the manufacture and drinking of alcohol, and subjecting women and non-Muslims to strict codes of public morality as defined by the government. The primary enforcement agents of vague notions of honour, reputation, and morality are the Popular Police and the Popular Committees (neighbourhood associations). In the name of protecting the moral health of Sudanese society, the Popular Police and the Popular Committees seek to eradicate deviation from the official interpretation of morality with little regard for human rights protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VI. Conclusion and Recommendations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese government has conflated its own interpretation of Shari'a and its Islamization policies with Islam itself. In response to international criticism of its human rights record and penal legislation, the Sudanese government has invoked the right to freedom of religion. A paradoxical situation has arisen in which a significant portion of the population, both Muslim and non-Muslim, is denied its right to freedom of religion in the name of the Sudanese government's right to impose its own particular interpretation of religious law. According to international human rights law, however, freedom of religion is conferred upon individuals, not states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government denounces Sudanese and foreign critics as enemies of Islam, even if these critics are observant Muslims. The government's ban on independent political activity and criticism of official policies has denied Sudanese citizens meaningful access to the legislative process. Sudanese citizens also do not benefit from the basic protections offered by a constitution. The government has preferred to govern with the aid of emergency laws that grant it wide powers of political repression and social control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right of Sudanese citizens to the social and political system of their choice does not, however, grant the government of Sudan the right to disregard basic freedoms guaranteed by the international human rights treaties that Sudan has signed. The challenge Sudan faces is to ensure that every citizen, regardless of political opinion, religion or race, enjoys the full range of internationally-mandated freedoms. The Sudanese government should not seek to evade its obligations by invoking cultural or religious particularity. Indeed, such arguments should be viewed with skepticism as long as they are used to rationalize governmental human rights violations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Gunmen killed three Spanish nationals working for Medecins du Monde-Spain (MDM) in Ruhengeri, northwestern Rwanda on 18 January. Reuters reported that the killers checked the passports of the victims, two men and a woman, and then shot them through the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assaults also left three Rwandan soldiers dead and a US national, who also worked for MDM, severely injured. Rwandan authorities told AFP that an unspecified number of attackers set upon the headquarters of MSF-Holland, but were repulsed by security forces. Then they attacked the compound containing MDM, Save the Children, and finally the military camp of Muhoza. Major Wilson Rutayisire of Rwanda's information office told AFP that grenades, rockets and machine-guns were heard in the battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attackers are alleged to be members of the Hutu ex-FAR and Interahamwe, who were apparently looking for cash and medical supplies. However, humanitarian sources commented that the attackers had left cash and portable computers on the premises when they fled. AFP said that the attackers had all escaped into the countryside. A former ex-FAR corporal who worked as a security officer for MDM was arrested after the assailants reportedly shouted his name during the attack. MDM announced in a communique that it was suspending its activities in Rwanda &quot;until the circumstances of this tragedy are cleared up.&quot; Some expatriate humanitarian workers have been temporarily removed from the area pending the outcome of NGO/UN/government meetings to discuss security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Gisenyi prefecture is considered a particularly high-risk area the attack was the worst carried out against aid agencies in the region. Several expatriate workers in Rwanda feel that humanitarian agencies have been specifically targeted in order to drive them out of the area. Most of the recent attacks, which are attributed to members of the ex-FAR/Interahamwe, have been concentrated in the provinces of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, which borders on Zaire and is home to several thousand Hutu returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 11, a hospital in Kabaya was attacked and its pharmacy pillaged by a militia force of some 60 men. Three Rwandans were killed and another three were injured in the incident, and two foreign surgeons working with MSF received death threats. The following day, 12 Rwandans were killed by militiamen outside Giciyi. In the same area, grenades were thrown at a construction truck owned by a Chinese company engaged in road repairs. On 13 January, armed Hutu men beat, robbed and threatened to kill UN human rights observers working in the area. A witness told Reuters that when the human rights observers were beaten up on Monday, more than 100 local people stood around laughing and clapping their hands in encouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AFP and Burundi radio reported that Burundi's intelligence services arrested and were searching the homes of former president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and other leading Tutsis on 19 January. The arrests come after several radical Tutsi leaders spoke out against Burundi's military leader Major Pierre Buyoya in recent weeks. Bagaza, who is regarded by many observers as a Tutsi extremist, was president from 1976 until he was displaced by Buyoya in a 1987 military coup. On Monday, Burundian authorities announced that Bagaza had been placed under house arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagaza has been outspoken in his criticism of both the coup, stating that it would not resolve Burundi's problems, and the military's choice of Buyoya as leader. A spokesperson for Bagaza told AFP that other Tutsis arrested included Bagaza's nephew Innocent Sabiyumva, Colonel Pascal Ntako, and Deo Niyonzima. Deo Niyonzima, formerly a Dominican monk, is the head of the organization Youth Solidarity for the Defence of the Minorities (SOJEDEM), a radical Tutsi movement influential among young Tutsis. On Friday, the intelligence service was also reported to have held 22 members of the SOJEDEM executive committee for questioning. No arrests were reported in Hutu circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 17 January, a spokesperson for the main Hutu-dominated movement in Burundi, National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), claimed that Buyoya's regime has killed nearly 40,000 civilians since it seized power in July 1996, reported AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNDD charge that over 3,000 civilians have been killed by the Tutsi- dominated army in Kayanza province alone since December 1996. Religious sources gave AFP similar estimates of civilians killed as a result of army operations against Hutu rebels in Kayanza province. The region's military commander denied the figure, saying only 30 people had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In a 16 January press conference, following his tour of rebel held towns, Laurent-Desire Kabila told AFP that more than 60 people were killed over the last week in skirmishes between Zairian troops (FAZ) and Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo-Zaire (ADFL) rebels near Lubutu in eastern Zaire. He further claimed that 50 FAZ and two white mercenaries were among those killed. Kabila added that his number two, Andre Ngandu Kisase, who has been absent from the scene since early January, had been wounded in an ambush but did not provide any further details. A security source in the region told Reuters that Kisase had actually been killed by Mai-Mai in an ambush near Butembo on 8 January. There has been no independent confirmation of this story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila's press conference also included a message to FAZ forces that a military coup to overthrow the Kinshasa government would be detrimental to Zaire, resulting in her &quot;Balkanization&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In a move that analysts attribute to the recent renewal of fighting between rebel and Zairian forces (FAZ)and the threatened counter-offensive, ADFL forces have tightened controls and clamped down on communication between Goma and the outside world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN sources said that two additional way stations have been opened in rebel held territory at Karuba and Kilolwire, located 17 km west and 35 km north of Sake. These way stations were opened to assist Rwandan refugees stranded in the Masisi area as a result of the prevailing insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Doctor Abdou Moudi, a WHO official in Kinshasa, informed the international community that a cholera epidemic was evolving in Tingi-Tingi, said Reuters. He said some 56 cases have already been diagnosed among the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On 15 January, Honore Ngbanda the president's security advisor told Zairian state radio that rumours in the national and international press that Mobutu was to undergo fresh surgery for cancer, were based on malicious political speculation. He said that the doctors were happy with the results of Mobutu's medical tests and following a few days rest he was expected to return to Zaire. However, Reuters reported that Mobutu was once again admitted to hospital on Saturday. Members of his entourage refused to comment on this latest admission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* AFP reported that authorities in Zaire have ordered the re-registration of all vehicles, estimated at around 363,000, in a campaign to counter the widespread thefts, which occurred during the 1991 and 1993 looting of Kinshasa. The re-registration which costs $126 US is expected to bring nearly 300 million dollars into the public coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Arusha, Tanzania, British reporter Lindsey Hilsum testified before the UN International Tribunal at the trial of the first defendant Jean-Paul Akayesu, former mayor of the central Rwandan town of Taba. Hilsum, a freelance journalist, testified as to the horrors she had witnessed as the 1994 massacres began. According to AFP, Hilsum's testimony was aimed at establishing that mass killings that taken place as part of widespread plan of genocide against those of Tutsi ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A third suspect in the Rwandan genocide trials, Francois Bizimutima received the death sentence on Friday. According to a Reuters report, the first two defendants to receive the death penalty, Deogratias Bizimana and Egide Gatanaze, filed appeals on 16 January within the statutory 15-day deadline. Under Rwanda's Genocide Law passed in 1996, those convicted must file an appeal within 15 days of conviction and it must be heard within three months by the Court of Appeal. If the sentences are upheld, the two men face execution by firing squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to an AFP report, a government delegation from Rwanda's ongoing war crimes tribunal was expected to arrive in South Africa on 19 January to discuss possible areas of cooperation between the Rwandan tribunal and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The TRC, which was established to probe into human rights abuses committed during South Africa's political struggle is empowered to grant reparations to the victims as well as amnesty or indemnity from prosecution to perpetrators who confess their crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A previous visit to Kigali in September 1996 by a delegation from the South African TRC assisted Rwanda in formulating a reparation policy to deal with the victims of the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to AFP, a government Information Bulletin issued 16 January gives Ugandan public leaders, &quot;from the president to heads of departments, chairpersons of local councils and even school heads,&quot; until January 31 to declare their wealth or face disciplinary action. The order is in line with the parliamentary Leadership Code Statute passed in 1992 in response to public concern over alleged corruption and other malpractice in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* At least 100 people living in the north of Kitgum district, Uganda, are estimatedto have been killed and 20,000 people displaced from their homes followingattacks by the Lords Resistance Army. Displaced people from Lokung, about 15 km south of the border with Sudan, first began arriving in Kitgum town on 11 January. Individuals interviewed by aid workers said that LRA rebels had arrived in Lokung and distributed leaflets ordering them to leave their homes for Kitgum. They then began killing people and burning their homes and granaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of 16 January the local authorities estimated that there were 10,000 displaced people living in Kitgum town, with another 5,000 near Palabek and 5, 000 more in the area between Lokung and Padibe. However, LRA attacks near Palabek were reported to be continuing last Thursday. In a Kitgum hospital there are patients suffering from severe wounds received during the attacks.  Several patients had head wounds where they had been beaten with axes. The hospital is supported by AVSI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Kitgum has experienced abductions in recent months as well as insecurity arising from LRA rebels passing through the district, such killings and large-scale displacement have until now been focussed on Gulu district to the west. These attacks have prompted debate as to whether the LRA is now increasingly targeting Kitgum and seeking to control a stretch of territory in the north of the district.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - UN and NGO sources point out that there is a growing human catastrophe in Burundi, which has gone largely unnoticed due to crises elsewhere in the region. One UN official described the situation as the &quot;most critical emergency&quot; in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing economic sanctions against Burundi are rendering relief operations virtually impossible, with one of the greatest difficulties being the refusal of the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) to acknowledge requests from humanitarian agencies for the exemption of more fuel supplies. The numbers of forced regroupments into camps by the authorities are also said to be on the increase, making life difficult for people who are thus denied access to their land. The problem is exacerbated by inadequate medical facilities, shelter and the lack of potable water. The repatriation of refugees from conflict zones elsewhere in the region is also compounding the Burundi issue. Returnees are received at a transit camp outside Bujumbura, from where they are pressured to return almost immediately to their homes in the war zones they were trying to escape. Gaining access to the returnees by relief workers is extremely difficult.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundi's Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama yesterday alleged that some countries imposing sanctions on his country had done so in a bid to prevent peace ever returning to Burundi. Speaking on the BBC's Kirundi service, he urged the international community to push for revoking the embargo. He accused certain countries of &quot;provocation&quot; by &quot;returning criminals to Burundi without informing us&quot;. Referring to last Friday's incident in which some 120 refugees were killed upon being sent back by Tanzania, Rukingama repeated that the soldiers who had gone to meet them flew into a panic after a woman returnee threw a hand grenade towards them. He again stated that the returnees were members of the Hutu rebel group, Palipehutu, but stressed that the security forces should avoid the recurrence of such incidents. &quot;However, we also appeal to the international community to do its best to prevent refugees outside the country from crossing the Burundi border to kill Burundi citizens,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Yesterday at 15:00 local time the governor of Kisangani, eastern Zaire, informed humanitarian sources that the temporary restriction on the air route between Kisangani and Amisi/Lubutu had been lifted. WFP recommenced normal operations with a cargo flight to Amisi this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistant High Commissioner for Refugees announced that the UN is negotiating with Zaire to arrange voluntary repatriation by air of the most vulnerable refugees among the more than 200,000 Rwandans currently trapped near Lubutu and Shabunda in eastern Zaire. UNHCR hopes to negotiate with Zaire and Rwanda a secure land corridor to facilitate the repatriation of refugees who are healthy enough to walk back to Rwanda. The senior UNHCR official, also told Reuters that there was no question of sending people back to Burundi after last week's massacre by Burundian troops of 122 Hutus expelled from Tanzania. The UNHCR hoped Tanzania would allow thousands of Rwandan refugees still in Tanzania to be screened to determine whether they want to go home or seek asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tensions in Kinshasa are growing following last week's introduction of new larger denomination banknotes. AZADHO, Zaire's main human rights organization, told Reuters that it had called for the withdrawal of the banknotes because of their potential social consequences. The last introduction of new banknotes led to the January 1993 riots and looting of Kinshasa. Radical opposition leaders have also called for a boycott of the new bills. Many moneychangers refuse to touch the new banknotes claiming that people are reluctant to accept them. Moneychangers said that the reduced circulation, partly because of the boycott, had allowed the exchange rate to stabilize around 160,000 NZ to the dollar over the last few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, yesterday continued the trial of the first defendant, Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former mayor of Taba commune in Gitarama prefecture. During the hearing, he personally questioned a witness who had accused him of torturing her and killing her son and daughter-in-law. The witness, known as &quot;N&quot; for her own protection, testified the previous day that Akayesu had held two rallies to encourage Hutus to exterminate Tutsis. The prosecution will call a total of 30 witnesses for the Akayesu case. The court's rules allow suspects to interrogate witnesses themselves; however, following yesterday's sitting the court ruled that the accused could no longer cross-examine witnesses. The presiding Judge Laity Kama gave the ruling as part of a decision to prevent Akayesu from dismissing his two lawyers after he twice fired previous counsel.  Rony Zachariah, a doctor with aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) which was based in Butare in April 1994, testified that he had seen hundreds of corpses and scores of Tutsis being killed by militia units in a series of incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, four more suspects will soon be transferred to Arusha from Cameroon where they had been in detention, following a decree signed by President Paul Biya. AFP said two of the suspects, Colonel Theoneste Bagasora and Andre Ntagerura, were close to former Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana whose death in a mysterious plane crash sparked off the 1994 genocide. The third suspect Ferdinand Nahimana was in charge of the Hutu extremist Radio Mille Collines which incited ethnic hatred, while the fourth Col. Anatole Nsengiyumva, was a former head of military intelligence under Habyarimana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to AFP, the Ugandan government denied allegations that it was massing troops on its northern border ready to launch an attack on Sudan and instead accused Khartoum of harbouring expansionist ambitions. The Ugandan Minister of Defence Amama Mbabazi said, &quot;These are the usual allegations by Sudan against Uganda,&quot; accusations which could be a ploy by Khartoum for possible aggression against Uganda. Both sides continue to accuse the other of supporting rebel movements in the other's territory. Sudan claims Uganda is supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) which recently captured the town of Maban on the southern front of the Blue Nile region.  Ugandan accuses Sudan of assisting the Lords Resistance Army (LRA).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - More Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire are coming forward to request repatriation. Missionary sources, believed to be working in Kingulube, 170 km east of Shabunda, said they had been approached by a group of refugees who claimed that some 1,500 ex-FAR and Interahamwe militia had recently left their camp heading east and northeast towards Walikale and Virunga National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees alleged they had been controlled and intimidated against repatriating by the ex-FAR. Free of ex-FAR control, they were now requesting assistance to repatriate to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian workers say refugee leaders in Shabunda continue to refuse all suggestions of repatriation for the present. As the refugee sites are organized along the Rwandan administrative lines, prefecture to commune, these leaders retain significant control over the refugee population. However, refugees themselves in Lubutu and Shabunda have informed missionary and UN sources that they are prepared to march back to Rwanda if they are provided with enough food and security guarantees. Most of them - except for vulnerable groups in the Lubutu area - are believed to be in relatively good condition to undertake such a trek. The health condition of refugees on the Shabunda to Kingulube axis is unknown. UNHCR hopes to send a mission out of Shabunda by bicycle or motorcycle to some of these sites within the next few days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in both Lubutu and Shabunda originate from the South Kivu camps around Bukavu and Uvira. UN estimates of the Shabunda refugee population indicate that some 55% came from Uvira and 45% from Bukavu. Unlike their North Kivu counterparts these refugees were not permitted a safe corridor to return to Rwanda following the ADFL offensive. Uvira and Bukavu refugees were instead pursued by ADFL rebels westward, deeper into the forest. The South Kivu camps had a significant concentration of intellectuals and political elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to a BBC report, Kisangani airport remains open. However, the Zairean regional governor did announce the closure, for military reasons, of the air axis between Kisangani to Lubutu/Tingi-Tingi and Amisi for today and tomorrow. Tingi-Tingi contains some 120,000 refugees and Amisi some 40,000.  Sources in the area indicate that the rebels have reconnaissance parties as close as seven kms to Amisi which is also the location of a strategically important bridge over the Oso river. Increased activities by Zairean soldiers have also been reported in the area. Earlier, the Zairean authorities had proposed moving all the refugees to Amisi. This would have placed a sizeable civilian population in the midst of either a rebel advance or a Zairean counter-offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday a WFP cargo plane left the Lubutu area carrying several expatriate workers from the Lubutu /Amisi region. The plane arrived at Kisangani after the 17:00 curfew and was refused permission to land; it then flew on to Kinshasa. WFP also said two privately-leased 4x4 trucks were commandeered by the Zairean military yesterday and the WFP logo removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In a bid to consolidate his gains, ADFL leader Laurent Kabila this week began a tour of rebel-held territory in eastern Zaire. Accompanied by his security aide Jean Kabongo, he left his Goma stronghold on Tuesday and flew to Bukavu. According to sources in Goma, quoted by AFP, he flew on to Bunia yesterday and may also visit Beni and Butembo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Continued fighting and looting in eastern Zaire have resulted in a stream of refugees crossing the border into the northwest Ugandan district of Arua, Ugandan radio reported yesterday. It said the number had reached 590 by January 6 and &quot;thousands&quot; more were poised to cross. Local officials in Arua had appealed to the national government and UNHCR for assistance. The returnees, mostly women and children, are for the most part Ugandans who were living in Zaire. Some West Africans and Zaireans have also crossed the border.  The new arrivals said they were escaping excessive looting by Zairean soldiers retreating from the rebel advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Burundi authorities have accused Hutu rebels of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) of massacring 22 people in the volatile northwest Cibitoke province. Defence Ministry spokesman, Col. Isaie Nibizi, interviewed by Burundi radio, said rebels launched an attack overnight Monday in Rugombo, killing 22 mostly women, children and old people with machetes and knives. Four more people were injured. Nibizi said the local governor and military officials had visited the area and helped to bury the dead. Nibizi also spoke about the incident in Muyinga province last week when soldiers opened fire on Hutu returnees from Tanzania, killing some 120. He said the returnees were from the rebel Palipehutu party &quot;which is why the soldiers did not make any mistakes and why the incident took place&quot;. An investigation was underway, he added. UN officials report that the provincial military commander has been sacked and that human rights observers have been denied access to Kobero where the killings occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundian President Pierre Buyoya on Tuesday met political leaders, the first meeting of its kind since the unbanning of political parties last September. Speaking on national radio, Buyoya said the purpose of the meeting was to create a framework for regular political meetings and to discuss the forthcoming national debate. He described the national debate, scheduled for later this month, as &quot;a clean page intended to bring Burundians closer together for discussions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Aid organisations yesterday warned that Rwanda will need tens of thousands of tonnes of food aid this year to cope with the massive influx of returnees. The Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Food Programme, in a report based on a December mission to Rwanda, predicted that the food shortfall during the first half of 1997 would be the equivalent of 141,000 tonnes of cereals. Commercial imports would only make up part of the deficit, the report added. It estimated that 81,000 tonnes of cereals and 33,000 tonnes of vegetable products would be required during the first six months of the year to feed more than 2.5 million people, or a third of the population.  The report also warned that Rwanda needed a huge input from donor countries to rehabilitate the agricultural sector otherwise it would remain heavily dependent on food aid for the next few years. (For further information on food security in the region, please see IRIN paper dated 23 December 1996.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN human rights operations have been temporarily suspended in southern parts of Rwanda's Gisenyi prefecture following an attack on staff members three days ago. A press release issued yesterday by the Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Rwanda said activities had been temporarily suspended in the Kabaya and Ngororero sub-prefectures. According to the statement, four members of the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) were attacked by 10 unidentified armed men, although no serious injuries were sustained. The incident is under investigation by the local authorities and HRFOR. All other UN operations in Gisenyi continue as normal, the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tanzanian police have launched a crackdown on Rwandan refugees who tried to flee deeper into the country rather than face repatriation. A total of 6, 354 refugees who ventured into forests in the Ngara region had been apprehended by Tuesday and handed over to Rwandan officials at the Rusumo border crossing. Ngara District Commissioner Evans Balama said the crackdown would continue until all aliens had left Ngara. He urged local residents to assist the police in flushing out the refugees. Balama added that the operation had also resulted in netting 8,441 Burundians who entered the country illegally. They had been transferred to the Lukole refugee camp in Ngara district. An exercise to transfer 60,000 Burundians from Kitali camp to Lukole also began on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Church officials in Burundi claimed other massacres occurred last month, in the northern province of Kayanza. Eyewitnesses reportedly told the bishop of Ngozi that soldiers killed some 3,000 people in the Gatara, Rango and Butaganzwa areas between December 2 and 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, military commander Cyrille Ndayirukiye, quoted by AFP, dismissed the figure as exaggerated although he admitted about 30 people had been killed. Both rebel and military attacks were said to be on the rise in northern Kayanza, and the increase in ethnic tension was making it difficult for humanitarian organisations to operate. News of the alleged massacre came through as the US State Department condemned the killing of some 120 refugees who were returned to Burundi from Tanzania on Friday. &quot;This massacre is only part of a pattern of violence in Burundi which must cease,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said yesterday. He also called for all-party talks and a ceasefire in Burundi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen people were sentenced to death in Burundi last year for offences linked to ethnic massacres which broke out after the assassination of president Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993. The president of the appeal court, Domitille Barancira, said the death sentences were confirmed out of 45 appeal cases that had been heard so far. A total of 139 cases have been appealed. Barancira told AFP that those tried had been accused of murder, assassination, offences against state security, membership of armed bands and armed robbery. She added that no executions had been carried out since cases of cannibalism were punished about 15 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief organisations report that large numbers of newly displaced persons continue to arrive at the hospital in Bubanza, northern Burundi, with 250 people registered on one day alone. Many of them showed signs of acute malnutrition. The new arrivals speak of continued instability in the hills north of the town. A new centre is being built in the hospital grounds to cope with the overwhelming requirements of malnourished people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundi's Defence Minister Firmin Sinzoyiheba kicked off a campaign to lift regional economic sanctions against his country by holding talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, the Kenyan 'Daily Nation' reported today.  He is expected to meet other regional leaders in the next few weeks.  According to Museveni's press secretary, Sinzoyiheba explained the detrimental effect of sanctions on the country but Museveni insisted any decision to lift the embargo would be have to be made collectively. Uganda stressed Burundi must abide by the conditions set by regional leaders when sanctions were imposed last year. These include a dialogue with Hutu rebels.  Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame, during a visit to Cyangugu prefecture last week, said regional leaders were looking into how the economic embargo against Burundi could be lifted. He expressed hope that common ground would be found. While in Cyangugu, he held talks with the director of the Bugarama cement factory to discuss increasing production for future export to neighbouring Zaire and Burundi, Rwandan radio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A court in Kigali will hand down a verdict on January 20 on a Burundian accused of involvement in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. The prosecution yesterday demanded the death penalty against 50 year-old Leonidas Ndikumwami who had refused to plead, saying his lawyer had no time to prepare his defence. The court refused the request for an adjournment, despite granting a similar request the same day by another defendant, former politician Froduald Karamira who is allegedly one of the architects of the genocide. Ndikumwami is accused of crimes against humanity, genocide and leading a group which carried out murders in the Kigali area. Meanwhile, 30 public prosecutors were sworn in by Prime Minister Pierre-Celestin Rwigyema on Monday. The premier described the swearing-in ceremony as a big step towards the reconciliation process in the country, Rwandan radio reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The controversial issue of providing adequate shelter for new and old caseload returnees in Rwanda is posing a major challenge to aid agencies and the Rwandan government, with the latter estimating that some 200,000 new houses are required. Various concerns have been raised including the lack of an integrated national shelter strategy, construction of centralised as opposed to decentralised communities, poor location selection and lack of supporting infrastructure. UN sources note that the process to move old caseload returnees into new housing has created an immediate demand for some 160,000 homes. The problem is exacerbated by some of the current residents refusing to vacate the houses for the returning owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A WFP plane which landed in Amisi, near Lubutu in eastern Zaire, yesterday was surrounded by Zairean soldiers and refugees and temporarily detained. As a result, WFP has suspended flights to the area as of today and says the Zairean government has prohibited all flights for three days. WFP says it was supplying 80 percent of food needs to the camp, 50 percent of which was by air. It will now continue to truck food in by road but points out that the operation will be greatly hampered by poor roads, limited truck availability and general insecurity. Sources say renewed fighting has broken out between Walikale and Amisi with Zairean troops attempting to flee the area. The front is reported to be moving closer to Amisi, and refugees are also preparing to flee, possibly to Tingi-Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Requests for repatriation appear to be on the increase. UNHCR reported yesterday that the number of refugees gathered on the hills behind Bukavu had grown to over 11,000 in the last few days. They are grouped in two places: at Bunyakiri along the road to Walikale and at Shaminunu some 60kms northwest of Bukavu. However, access to these areas is very difficult and UNHCR has requested permission to establish a temporary transit centre on the road between Bunyakiri, Shaminunu and Bukavu where the refugees could assemble.  The rebel military authorities on the ground have yet to accede to the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In an interview with Zairean daily &quot;Le Soft&quot; (9 January), the governor of the Bank of Zaire, Patrice Djamboleka L'Oma Okitongono, explained measures taken by the bank to limit the speculation-driven inflationary impact of the new bank notes. One of the reasons given for the introduction of the new notes was that years of hyperinflation had rendered the net value of some of the smaller bank notes, such as 10,000NZ, less then their production cost, 6.  6 cents US. In order to prevent speculation and contain the inflation impact of the new bills, the Bank of Zaire claims to have injected 2 million dollars US into the banking system, limited the release of new bills to 250 billion daily for the month of January, restricted their release to bank, and requested that all payments to the state over 200,000 NZ (just over $1 US) be made by cheque. The aim is to limit the number of new bills in circulation, maintaining as many small notes in circulation as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is speculation that President Mobutu's visit to France was unplanned but was necessitated by a relapse. The introduction of the new bank notes coinciding with Mobutu's departure from Zaire has made many Kinshasa residents uneasy. According to one businessman, tensions and anti-government sentiments are so strong that any incident could ignite a riot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean-based Ugandan rebels claim to have killed nearly 500 Ugandan soldiers since they launched their assault on the country in November. In a statement issued Monday, the Allied Democratic Front (ADF) said 491 soldiers had been killed, six military installations had been overrun and over 600 guns captured. The statement added that up to 90 rebels had lost their lives and it accused the Ugandan government of inflating casualty figures. However military sources yesterday denied the claims, AFP reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata will visit the Great Lakes region next month, a UNHCR spokeswoman announced yesterday. Her 10-day visit is due to begin on February 6 during which she will travel to Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Although representatives of major political parties in Burundi are scheduled to meet later this month to discuss the country's political future, the CNDD, the political arm of one of the leading rebel groups, has not been invited to participate. Many observers believe that lasting peace in the country will only be possible with the participation of all opposition groups in talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six months after neighboring countries imposed an economic embargo against Burundi, there is little sign that the sanctions will be lifted. Despite exemptions for selected humanitarian supplies, NGOs and UN agencies continue to face delays in importing essential exempted goods. Fuel reserves of humanitarian agencies are now virtually empty. Without authorization by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) to import new fuel, the ability of humanitarian organizations to continue to serve hundreds of thousands of Burundians of all ethnic groups will be in doubt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although consumer and household items have remained on store shelves in Burundi since the regional economic sanctions were first imposed, smuggling and the breaking of sanctions by entrepreneurs has received fresh attention.  A report published in a weekly Kenyan newspaper, and picked up by international wire services, provided examples of organized smuggling into the country. The article noted that a convoy of ten fuel tankers was seen driving towards Bujumbura, their license plates obscured by mud. Five of the tankers were said to have come from Rwanda, the other five from Tanzania.  Other products supplied through smuggling include Zambian cement, salt from Tanzania and consumer products from Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report on sanctions violations came after published accusations that the Burundian government was involved in smuggling arms into the country. The CNDD claimed that during the last weekend of December, an Egyptian owned plane landed in Bujumbura and off-loaded 34 mt of munitions and military uniforms. The cargo flight was said to have originated in Ostende, and to have returned with 24 mt of tea. The CNDD made the accusations in a letter to the chairman of the RSCC who is also the Tanzanian High Commissioner to Kenya.  Both the Burundian military and the Egyptian government denied the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the German government is investigating a German company suspected of illegally exporting arms to Burundi. The investigation was launched after customs officials at Brussels airport seized seven engines and other parts from Soviet BDRM-2 armored vehicles. The company, Fahrzeugwerke Neubrandenburg, is suspected of attempting to export the goods after a request for an export license was turned down by authorities in October. The company has denied the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Burundian political parties, except for the CNDD, have been invited to participate in a national debate to discuss the conflict in the country. In his New Year's address, President Buyoya said the talks would show the international community that Burundi was not afraid to tackle its own problems. In an acknowledgment that some Tutsi hard liners continue to oppose dialogue with Hutu dominated opposition groups, he said that there should be no fear of talks &quot;since we know that truth lies on our side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a government spokesman, about 60 people from across the political spectrum will take part in the debate which will begin January 27 and last four days. &quot;If there is a cease-fire and an end to the massacres, then fine&quot; the CNDD could participate, a government spokesman said. The debate will be divided into five major themes: the causes of the world's divisions and wars; peace and reconciliation in Africa; the nature of the Burundian conflict; past debates on national unity and the democratization of Burundi; steps to resolve the conflict in Burundi. President Buyoya has promised a debate since assuming power last July, and Burundian officials hope that their holding of the debate will help convince neighboring countries to remove sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in Zaire indicate that ADFL rear positions in Zaire were coming under pressure from Burundian Hutu rebels belonging to the FDD operating out of the Virunga National Park. The rebels are said to be planting mines and staging ambushes along the Goma-Bukavu route. Many of the Hutu rebels who had been operating in the former camps in eastern Zaire have since fled to Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian government has made serving a year of military service mandatory for all current first and second year university students. Most students at the campuses in Bujumbura and Gitega are Tutsi. The main Hutu dominated FRODEBU party condemned the move as &quot;national suicide&quot;, saying the solution to the country's problem lay in negotiations, not war. Details of the military service program have not been finalized. It is still unclear when the program will take affect and how many students will be directed to serve. Prior to the July coup, students paraded through the streets of Bujumbura demanding to be enlisted by the military to fight Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Special Envoy to Burundi, Howard Wolpe, arrived in Burundi January 6 for four days of meetings with Burundian officials and others involved in the search for peace in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mine incidents continue, with twelve confirmed incidents in which both civilian and military vehicles have been destroyed by antitank mines over the last eight weeks. Eight of the incidents occurred in Bujumbura Rural. Other provinces in which vehicles have detonated antitank mines include Kayanza, Muramvya and Bururi. Sources indicate that for every detonated mine, the Burundian military is locating and disarming some 20 mines. Antipersonnel mines have also been found in Kayanza Province, but to date there have been no reported injuries from their detonation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the increased use of mines, the UN security cell is conducting mine awareness sessions to help humanitarian staff who must conduct operations in potentially mined areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banditry is also on the rise, with expatriate houses and offices increasingly being targeted for attack. At 7:30 am on the morning of January 8, the house/office of an American NGO was raided by 5 armed men who stole a vehicle and computer equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks on displaced camps continue. During the night of January 2, rebels attacked a displaced camp in Muramba commune of Bubanza province. Between 15 and 30 residents of the camp were killed and an unknown number injured. On January 9, in Gihanga commune in the same province, rebels opened fire on a small gathering. The incident resulted in an unknown number of casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 10, the Burundian military killed 124 Burundian refugees from camps in western Tanzania who had been transported to the Burundian border by the Tanzanian military. The killings occurred at the Kobero crossing point in Muyinga province. Exact details of the incident are unclear. A spokesman for the Burundian government confirmed that an incident occurred but provided few details. He said that an internal military investigation would be conducted and those responsible would be punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are at least 160,000 Burundian refugees in camps in western Tanzania.  Those Burundians transported to the border were from camps near Kitali.  According to some reports, they had been involved in skirmishes earlier in the week between members of the FDD, PALIPEHUTU and other Hutu rebel groups living in the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambushes continue on RN 3, the main road from Bujumbura leading south to Rumonge. Several Burundian military vehicles were ambushed along the route January 11. This road is now considered to be one of the most dangerous in the country and is completely closed to UN traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Affected populations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports that as of January 6, some 78,000 Burundian refugees from camps in Zaire had returned home. Of those, some 16,000 passed through the Gatumba transit center outside Bujumbura. The majority, however, returned directly to the provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza, two of the most severely war affected provinces in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two new regroupment camps have been identified in Karuzi. It is now estimated that the number of displaced in that province alone is approximately 100,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both rebel and military attacks are reported to be on the rise in northern Kayanza. With ethnic tensions high in the province, humanitarian organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to provide services to the area's most vulnerable populations. MSF-Holland, the NGO responsible for much of the province's emergency medical care was forced to pull out due to repeated threats against staff, and the refusal of local authorities to allow them to serve more than one ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO is looking into a possible cholera outbreak in communities near Rumonge in southern Burundi. According to local press reports, approximately 250 people are suspected of having contracted the disease over the last several weeks with 10 fatalities. The Burundian government has blamed rebel sabotage of the town's water supply system for precipitating the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS reports that large numbers of newly displaced continue to arrive at or around the hospital in the town of Bubanza. Two hundred and fifty were registered on one day alone, many showing signs of acute malnutrition. Those arriving at the center report continued instability in the hills north of the town. With the health center overwhelmed by patients suffering from malnutrition, CRS with the assistance of UNICEF, is constructing a new center on the hospital grounds for therapeutic feeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS reports that it is completing preparations to distribute 450 mt of bean seeds to 38,000 families in Kirondo province. The province suffered from drought during the last planting season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Humanitarian Coordination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Griffiths, the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes, arrived in Bujumbura January 6 for two days of meetings with representatives of international humanitarian organizations and the Burundian government.  From a regional perspective, he said that Burundi continued to be the country in the region with the greatest need for international humanitarian intervention. He said that he would highlight the continued gravity of the situation in the country at a January 14 meeting in Nairobi of UN Humanitarian Coordinators from the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strategic framework for the Regional Consolidated Appeal Process is now in place. The appeal for funds for the Great Lake region will be launched February 6. In light of the fluidity of the situation in the Great Lakes, the appeal, which will be managed by DHA, will be reviewed every three months and revised accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch government has agreed to subsidize the Nairobi - Bujumbura humanitarian air link. The cost of tickets has been reduced from $260 each way to $180. The Dutch have agreed to fund 20 flights over the next ten week period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Impact of Sanctions on Humanitarian Operations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN and NGO humanitarian services in Burundi are threatened by the continued refusal of the RSCC to consider allowing international humanitarian agencies to import additional fuel reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since November 18, international humanitarian organizations have made several joint requests to the RSCC for a new allocation of fuel. To date, no authorization to import new supplies has been received. Today, both UN and NGO fuel reserves are virtually depleted. Essential programs have already been reduced. Agencies are now being forced to consider reducing their emergency relief operations even further. If a favorable decision by the RSCC is not taken immediately, agencies will be unable to provide life sustaining assistance to hundreds of thousands of extremely vulnerable people in Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent representative of Tanzania to the United Nations, Daudi Mwakawago, took over the mantle of office from his Costa Rican counterpart, Fernando Berrocal Soto, at a brief ceremony Tuesday in New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwakawago will preside over the group, which was established in 1964 to foster economic cooperation in the developing world, for one year. Tanzania was elected, by acclamation, to the group's chairmanship in October in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has 132 members from Africa, Asia, South and Central America, and the Caribbean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the secretary-general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has described the group as &quot;the moving spirit&quot; in the U.N. in the areas of economic and social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech at the ceremony, Annan said that the group had the responsibility of representing the interests, the hopes and the aspirations of the majority of the world's peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The group has always been a vital springboard for new development ideas and initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your work has enabled the U.N. to respond positively to the challenges of a rapidly changing international economic and social environment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEMA, Ghana (PANA) - A set of triplets were delivered Monday to a 37-year- old woman at the Pro Vita Specialist Hospital at Tema through in-vitro fertilization (IVF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This method of fertilization is the process whereby pregnancy is effected through the injection of a fertilized embryo into the womb through artificial insemination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The triplets, all boys weighing 2.4, 2.1 and 1.6 kilograms, were delivered by Caesarian section by the medical director of the hospital, Dr Joe Mainoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the media that mother and children were all doing well. However, he said that the baby with the least weight would be put under intensive care for an unspecified period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainoo said the hospital has made eight IVF deliveries since 1995. These included the triplets, and other deliveries of five girls and six boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He put the cost of this delivery method at 2.6 million cedis or the equivalent of 1,500 U.S. dollars, excluding the cost of drugs which, he said, were very expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name of the parents were not disclosed. Mainoo said the couple had, for the past 17 years, sought in vain for a child before they were put on the IVF programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainoo said the fertilization method becomes necessary when normal conception becomes impossible as a result of blockage of the fallopian tubes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A diversion will, therefore, have to be made through IVF, he said, whereby the sperms of the man and the egg of the woman are collected and fertilized in a test tube for between 40 and 72 hours before being implanted into the womb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainoo said the pregnancy of the woman lasted 34 weeks and three days. He had expected the pregnancy to have travelled 36 weeks but had to deliver her when she started showing labor pains Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - At lease 18 officers and men of the Mozambican Defence Force have been arrested by the military police on suspicion of involvement in the theft of 83 million meticais (about 7,200 U.S. dollars) and the falsification of documents in the center and south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military spokesman told the Mozambican news agency, AIM, that the thefts were discovered by the military's internal auditing services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main problem detected was at the Maputo Military Driving School.  Several of the detained are accused of stealing 62 million meticais from the school, selling military driving licenses, falsifying the school's wage scale, and illegally selling fuel belonging to the armed forces in the period from June to December 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also theft within the military police. In the Maputo branch of the military police, 14 million meticais, intended to pay wages for October, went missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar theft occurred in the Southern Regional Military Command, where seven million meticais, the October wages for several civilian staff, were stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To explain the disappearance of the wages, those in charge of the money said they were attacked by armed thieves on the way from the bank to the military units concerned and were forced to hand the cash over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIM quoted an unnamed military spokesman as saying that, even if this were true, it did not prove the innocence of those detained, since it meant they had disobeyed the army's security norms for the transport of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military audit also detected forged signatures on the wage sheets of a brigade stationed at Chimoio, capital of the central province of Manica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All those accused have been confined to their units, while the investigations continue. The military police intend to bring the cases to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The internal audit is continuing, in order to discover if there are any further cases of theft or misuse of funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Israel has no intention of cutting its ties with South Africa and will retain friendly relations with Pretoria in the future, an official of the Israeli Embassy has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We enjoy a good relationship with South Africa, and we wish to maintain that,&quot; said Zeev Luria, the Israeli Embassy political counsellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I want to reiterate that we are opposed to a South African arms deal with Syria because it could jeopardize the fragile peace process in the Middle East,&quot; he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reacting to a statement Monday by the South African government that Pretoria would no longer maintain a pro-Israel bias in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luria added that it was important to ensure that the peace process was strengthened instead of destabilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing all we can to change the government's mind, and intensive consultations and discussions with the South African Government are continuing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This official Israeli reaction follows Sunday's statement by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki that the new South Africa had scrapped the former government's pro-Israel bias in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't follow a policy in the Middle East such as the policy that was followed by the previous regime,&quot; he said, &quot;which was to form an alliance with Israel and be hostile to the rest of the countries in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the opposition National Party has appealed to Mbeki to veto the cabinet's provisional approval of a 650-million-U.S.-dollar arms deal involving the sale of tank-sighting equipment to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement in Cape Town on Monday, National Party foreign affairs spokesman Boy Geldenhuys said: &quot;As the future president of South Africa, Mr.  Mbeki dare not allow the interests of South Africa and all its people to be sabotaged by politically-driven, ill-considered decisions by the African National Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Cabinet is scheduled to discuss the entire question of the proposed Syrian arms deal at its first meeting of the year, Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The African National Congress (ANC), the dominant party in South Africa's first post-apartheid government, has accused the United States of bullyboy tactics and hypocrisy for threatening Pretoria over its proposed 650-million-U.S. dollar arms sale to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting ANC secretary-general Cheryl Carolus told a news conference Monday that the United States was trying to force South Africa into a biased policy in the Middle East by favoring Israel over the Arab states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We take strong exception to any country acting like a bullyboy in trying to essentially usurp our own foreign policy-making capacity,&quot; she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States itself has contributed in a very biased way in the region and that in itself creates problems,&quot; she added. &quot;It's really a bit much and self-righteous to then try to speak to other people about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These remarks echoed recent statements by South African President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. They said that South Africa would not be dictated to by any country and would make its own decision regarding arms sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reaction followed last week's statement by the United States, threatening to cut off some 120-million dollars in aid if South Africa went ahead with the proposed deal to sell tank-sighting equipment to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, South Africa has pointed out that an American defence contractor is involved in an at least one of three bids for the Syrian contract by companies in at least three European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That kind of hypocrisy of the United States -- to not do anything about that aspect of it -- we find quite disturbing and out of keeping with the role which we would hope that a major power such as the United States would play,&quot; Carolus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said South Africa was concerned that its actions should not upset the precarious balance in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we think the United States should also put its hand to its own bosom and take this question quite seriously,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolus also criticized the manner in which the U.S. handled the matter. If the United States wanted clarification on the deal, she said, it could have used normal diplomatic channels rather than having &quot;some petty government official standing up and attacking the sovereignty of another country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SOUTH AFRICAN music videos have once again emerged in competition as the cream of the crop in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six of the nine videos nominated for the R57 000 Best Music Video/Clip from Africa prize (Francophone countries excluded as they have their own award) at the highly influential annual Cannes Midem awards, hail from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And of those six, Devereux-Harris and Associates, a Johannesburg film production house headed by Pam Devereux-Harris, has scooped three of the nominations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are: Lucky Dube's I Want to Know What Love Is (directed by Kevin Yates); Woza Afrika's Buthetebele (directed by Lisa Brittan) and Tu Nokwe's Nyaka Nyaka (directed by Ivan Leathers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993 Devereux-Harris and Associates also won the Cannes Midem Best International Music Documentary Award with a film tracing the history of South African resistance pop, We've Got the Power, directed by Brittan. It was one of the more talked-about awards that year as it beat the acclaimed U2 Zoo Tour documentary to the prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted this week, Devereux-Harris said, &quot;It's a good thing South African music videos are being shown outside the territory. Hopefully this will open doors for young film-makers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other South African nominees are Mark Engels for his video of the Vicky Sampson song My African Dream; Melvin Khaoli and Life Morewane for their video of Buthi Hai Man by the new all-girl Soweto group Abo Babes and Lance Stehr for his Prophets of da City video, Understand Where I'm Coming From.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engels has already won the 1996 Asami Best Video award and been a finalist in the 1996 Kora All Africa Music Awards for the same video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted, he said: &quot;It stands to reason that South Africa has received so many nominations as we're the only sub- Saharan country with fully active film and music industries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that in an industry renowned for its lack of budgets and tight work schedules, he and Devereux-Harris have steadily been targeting a highly specialised market and devoting themselves to the development of the medium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other nominees in the category include Zimbabwe's Tendai Mupfurutsa with Character; Cape Verde's Cesaria Evoria for her Petit Pays and R-Street for their song Cola Nha Terra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nominees in the same award for French- speaking African countries include Papa Wemba and Kofi Olomide; Ismael Lo; Youssou 'N Dour and Meiway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The awards will be announced at a function in Cannes, France, on January 21 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The announcement of the Clinton administration's new foreign policy team in December sent shock waves through the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime. Two of the four new appointees have first hand experience of the rogue regime's activities and are now in a position to do something about them. The appointees were: Ambassador Madeleine Albright as Secretary of State; Senator William Cohen as Secretary of Defence; former National Security Advisor Tony Lake as director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and Samuel Berger, as National Security Advisor. The new foreign policy team will have a far greater understanding of the situation in Sudan than any of its predecessors have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understandably, the NIF regime greeted the appointments with apprehension and fear, and was tempted to make a knee-jerk response about the USA as the Great Satan. However, elements within the regime counselled caution and the NIF foreign minister, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, was instructed to send a perfunctory message of congratulations to Ambassador Albright, &quot;wishing her well and looking forward to working closely together on matters of mutual concern.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NIF regime is perhaps correct to worry about the new appointments because in the past it has attempted to present itself as a regional superpower and knows that American foreign policy does affect events around the world. The NIF regime has attempted too to export its terrorism to the USA and members of the new foreign policy team should be well aware of the regime's criminal activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Albright regularly dealt with the representatives of the NIF regime at the United Nations. She is on record when she visited Khartoum as President Clinton's special envoy, as telling the NIF leadership two years ago that if the rogue regime did not change its criminal ways and begin behaving as a responsible country ought to on the international scene, then others around the world would have to force the regime to change. Ms Albright knows full well that the changes have not taken place and now, as Secretary of State, she has the opportunity and power to make them happen. She will find documented evidence at the State Department of all the regime's crimes against the people of Sudan and the region . She will also inherit a team of young men and women who have put these crimes on the record over the past few years, and who will be pleased to help the new secretary of state act upon them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst it has never been the Gazette's practice to comment on appointments to the CIA or any other foreign intelligence agencies, former National Security Advisor Tony Lake brings a noteworthy knowledge of Africa to his new post at the CIA. It is to be hoped that he will use his experience in Africa as a young scholar and diplomat to devote some of the CIA's attention to the menace of the NIF regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Senator William Cohen at Defence and Samuel Berger at National Security are taking up positions in the two best informed departments of the US government with regards to the Sudanese conflict and the NIF regime. They would do well to continue with the administrators who covered the Sudanese situation during Mr Clinton's first administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long Term Worries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new appointments have come at a time when the USA is almost alone in recognizing the real menace presented by the NIF regime. If recent reports are to be believed, the USA is now prepared to move beyond words and to act practically to curb the rogue regime in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent media reports state that the administration has offered modest military assistance to the neighbouring countries to Sudan who have been targeted for destabilisation by the NIF regime. It is to be hoped that similar military assistance will also be offered to the Sudanese opposition which has recently opened up a further military front in Eastern Sudan. That would be the kind of help which would directly affect the regime. It is to be hoped too that the US administration's own considerations do not preclude such direct help to the Sudanese opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is heartening to note that the American media has begun to take a greater interest in the Sudanese conflict, and are urging the Clinton administration to adopt a more proactive stance. On 4 December the Washington Post newspaper published a strongly worded editorial in which it gave its support to current US policy towards Sudan and urged the international community to do even more:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is Sudan's distinction to be second probably only to Iran in propagating international terrorism and in subverting its weaker neighbours, all this by way of acting on the Khartoum regime's Islamic Fundamentalism tenets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the United Nations' shame to have demonstrated itself incompetent to deal with this authentic rogue state. Other African countries, including Egypt -whose president the Sudanese regime tried to murder last year - have appeased the regime, manufacturing considerations of African, Arab, or Islamic solidarity. Russia, China and France, from their seats on the Security Council, have devised one or another big power cause of convenience to protect Sudan from anything more that slaps on the wrist. As a result, the regime's external terrorism and subversion continue. So does its prosecution of long-standing internal religious war and its suppression of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the Unites States' contribution to have accepted the implications of the United Nations' weak stance and to have sought out an alternative way to check Sudan's depredations. In a region grimly familiar with ethnic rivalries and cross-border incursions, the Clinton administration now is funnelling modest arms supplies to three neighbours that Sudan has tormented. Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda can use the help to defend themselves and to support the fragmented and needy Sudanese opposition - if not to unseat the regime, then to contain it. By remaining at a discreet remove from the front line action, Washington can hope to shield itself against charges of being anti-Islam and pro-intervention and yet still make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Proposals for re-engaging diplomatically with Sudan periodically emerge in Washington. The argument is made that, with the military options being limited, the United States should wield a broader range of instruments, not just UN resolutions and American arms transfers but the contacts that come with diplomacy. At some point this will be good advice. At this point it seems a counsel of escapism. The well organised and financed National Islamic Front is the power behind the ruling military government. The front has a charismatic leader, Hassan El-Turabi, a vision of Sudan as the model of a new Islamic revolution and a focus on the United States as a useful devil. It menaces the peace and stability of its region, and beyond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 December the American television network NBC finally broadcast its programme on the NIF regime's condoning of slavery in Sudan. The film was made earlier on in the year but broadcast was delayed because of the presidential elections. The film showed convincingly that slavery remains one of the regime's tools for repressing the non-Arab and non-Moslem peoples of Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Central Investigation Co-ordination Department has been detaining journalists in connection with news items and articles published in newspapers and magazines which it suspects of violating the Penal Code and the Press Proclamation. The individuals frequently detained are the chief and deputy editors and sometimes the manager of the publisher of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Article 42 (1) of the Penal Code, in press matters it is the author of the text or the person who adopts it as his own and diffuses it with a criminal intent who shall be principally liable. If the person who committed the offence cannot be found, or if he is not amenable to Ethiopian courts, the editor of the printed publication shall have subsidiary liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to Article 10(3) (a) of the Press Proclamation No. 34/1992, the editor or journalist or publisher shall be responsible for the offence committed through the printed matter. The liability is for failing to ensure that the press product is free from any content that can give rise to liability; any criminal offence against the safety of the State or of the administration or of the national defence; any defamation or false accusation against any individual, nation/nationality, people</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or organization; any criminal instigation of one nationality against another or incitement of conflict between peoples; and any agitation for war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both the Penal Code and the Press Proclamation the liability is in lieu of the other. If the person who has a principal liability is charged, the person who has a subsidiary liability should not be charged. Because in press matters the punishment of one of the parties responsible in the order fixed by law precludes punishment of the other (see Art. 17(2) (b) of the Press Proclamation and Article 46 of the Penal Code).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, it is not right to detain simultaneously the chief and deputy editors and the manager of the publisher of the press. This act appears to be aimed at stifling the freedom of the press which is guaranteed by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basically in press matters there is no ground for detaining a person and then conducting the investigation. What is to be investigated? When an offence is committed through a press product, the evidence to be presented against the responsible person is the printed matter. It is the Court which determines whether or not an offence is committed through the printed matter.  And the only evidence that will be presented to the court is the printed matter. There cannot be any other evidence against the accused. If there is any other thing that the police may wish to know, it cannot be other than the name, age and address of the editor of the newspaper or magazine, including whether or not the press has the necessary license. Since the editor cannot be liable if the text of the printed matter is true, the investigating police officer may also wish to ascertain this. Other than this, however, there is nothing that the investigating police officer has to investigate. And it cannot take more that 30 minutes to investigate this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, what is the reason for detaining journalists for up to two months on the pretext of investigation? Why do courts frequently accept the request of the investigating police officers and repeatedly remand journalists to police custody for 14 days? Instead of watchfully safeguarding the rights of citizens, why do courts become instruments of the police and help them violate human rights?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 19(3), (4) and (6) of the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia provides that arrested persons have the right to be brought before a court within 48 hours; that on appearing before a court, they have the right to be given prompt and specific explanation of the reasons for their arrest; that they have the right to be released on bail; that when a request for a remand is made, the court may grant the request for a time strictly required to carry out the necessary investigation; that in granting the additional time, the court shall ensure the arrested persons right to a speedy trial. Article 63(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code also provides that any arrested person may be released on bail if the offence he is suspected of committing is not homicide, which carries a death penalty, or a rigorous imprisonment for fifteen years or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Article 28 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where the offence committed is not punishable with rigorous imprisonment as a sole or alternative punishment, the investigating police officer may release such a person on his executing a bond with or without sureties. Where the arrested person is not released on bond by the investigating police officer, he may apply to the court to be released on bail in accordance with the provisions of Article 64. If the police at the Central Investigation Coordination Department had no desire to harm the editors of the free press, they could and should have taken their statements and immediately released them on bail in accordance with Article 28 of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, the practice by both the police and the courts is contrary to the provision of the law. The proof for this is seen in what is happening to the editors of Tobya since last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editor of Tobya newspaper and magazine, Ato Taye Belachew, was detained on November 22 and the deputy editor, Ato Anteneh Merid, was detained on November 25, 1996. These journalists did not appear before a judge within 48 hours in accordance with the law. However, the Investigation Department on its own authority detained Ato Taye for 14 days and Ato Anteneh for 11 days and then brought them to court for the first time on December 6, 1996.  Nevertheless, they were returned to prison without appearing before a judge because it was said that the court would only see cases for which previous adjournments had been made. After staying for three days in prison, they were again taken to court on December 9, 1996. Again they were taken back because their turn did not come before the court wound its session. It was the same story on December 13, too. It was on December 16 that they appeared before a judge for the first time. However, on this day the Investigation Department requested for a remand on the pretext that it did not complete its investigation, that it had not yet received a response to its letter to the Ministries of Information and Trade, and that it had not yet got results of their finger print tests. But the legal counsellor of Ato Taye and Ato Anteneh opposed this request for remand on the ground that it was not necessary to detain a person to investigate press matters and that even if that was felt to be essential, the police had already kept the editors in detention for 24 days and hence had ample time to finalize their investigation within that time. Furthermore, as the police had already verified during previous detentions of the editors that the publisher of Tobya had the necessary legal licenses, no additional information was needed from these ministries. Nor is a finger print test required for a press case and even then their finger prints had already been taken and the results made available to the Department. On these grounds, the lawyer requested the court to release his clients on bail, but the judges rejected his pleas and granted the remand until December 23. Nevertheless, Ato Taye and Ato Anteneh were not brought to court even on this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they were brought to court on December 27, they were told that the panel of judges was incomplete and so they were returned to prison. Again, the same thing happened on December 30. Except for December 16, therefore, they have not yet appeared before a judge and are still illegally detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Goshu Moges, who replaced Ato Taye as editor and whose home was surrounded by policemen on December 12, was woken from his sleep and taken to the Investigation Department at 6:30 in the morning. After eight days of detention, he was brought to court. As usual the police requested for a remand saying that they had not completed their investigation and were granted to keep him in custody until January 3, 1997. However, the Department has not brought Ato Goshu to court either on that day or to date. He is being illegally kept under detention until this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Arega Wolde Qirqos, who became the editor when Ato Goshu was detained, was taken into custody on January 6 and has been under detention until now.  He has not yet been brought before a judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions of the Central Investigation Co-ordination Department appear to be taken out of malice and aimed at eliminating the free press. The weakening of the judicial system caused by the mass dismissal of judges also appears to have facilitated the conditions for the illegal detention of citizens on flimsy grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 29 of the constitution of the FDRE which provides for the freedom of expression states that every one has the right to hold opinions and to freedom of expression without any interference; that this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either in writing or print, in the form of art, or through any media of his choice; that in the interest of the free flow of information, ideas and opinions which are essential to the functioning of a democratic order, the press shall enjoy legal protection to ensure its operational independence; that freedom of expression and information cannot be limited on account of the content or effect of the point of view expressed; that in order to protect the well-being of the youth and the honour and reputation of individuals, legal limitation may be laid down on these rights; and that any propaganda for war, as well as the public expression of opinion intended to injure human dignity shall be prohibited by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This provision is closer in spirit to the provisions of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. However, the actions of the police against the editors of the free press contravene these constitutional provisions. EHRCO therefore requests the Ethiopian government to restrain the police from such acts and to effect the release of all journalists who are imprisoned without being convicted by a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EHRCO also calls on all States, human rights organizations, international agencies, religious institutions, and individuals who support the rule of law and respect for human rights in Ethiopia to do their best to make the Ethiopian government to respect freedom of the press and to stop the harassment and detention of the editors of the free press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A joint press release by the United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs (ARRA), stated that 4,128 Sudanese refugees had settled in Western Ethiopia (near Kunche village at Tongo Wereda in Benishangul-Gumuz Region), starting Tuesday, 7 January 1997. On average, a further 80 persons arrive in Kunche every day. Local Authorities report that another 15,000 Sudanese were on the border with Ethiopia, ready to make their way to Benshangul-Gumuz region. The first group of refugees fleeing the civil war and famine in southern Sudan made their way to the Kunche area in mid- November, 1996. The UNHCR and ARRA said they have established a field presence and constructed a wet feeding centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new arrivals are in a desperate state of famine, depending on wild yam- like tubers and various other roots,&quot; the press release stated. Findings of a joint assessment mission by the UNHCR, ARRA, and the World Food Programme (WFP) revealed that under-five malnutrition prevalence (less than 80 per cent weight for height) is around 22 per cent. The Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Commission (DPPC) brought initial food relief to the refugees, and 33mt of maize and other supplementary food items sent by the WFP arrived at the site on 30 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release noted that, &quot;The influx from the Blue Nile Region is expected to increase in the wake of an apparent massive military build-up by the Sudanese government in the Ura, Chali, Buny, Gezan and Kurmuk areas. Frequent flights of military planes over these areas are causing fear of aerial bombardment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 72,804 Sudanese refugees have entered Ethiopia since mid-1991, escaping famine and civil war, UNHCR/ARRA said. &quot;In view of the continuing conflict in Sudan,&quot; the release observed, &quot;it is not likely that these refugees will repatriate in the near future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - It is ironic that Tobia, a private Amharic weekly newspaper did not appear yesterday, when prominent and distinguished scholars are discussing human rights education in the capital. The Human Rights Education Workshop is organized by InterAfrica Group, a local NGO. The Workshop was opened on Monday and it is expected to close today with major recommendations.  Tobia didn't appear because, according to the publishers, they wanted to protest against the arrest of four of its top editors. Tobia is one of the most popular private newspapers. There is no doubt that regular readers felt its absence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no official word from the government why Tobia's editors are in jail. All of us, including the government will agree that Ethiopia would be better off with positive protection of freedom of expression and information.  The importance of freedom of expression is expressed many times at many forums. The main problem is the implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of expression and information has been recognized as an essential foundation of democratic society by institutions and governments around the world. The United Nations General Assembly, at its first session, on 14 December 1946, declared:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Freedom of information is a fundamental human right...the touchstone of all the freedom to which the United Nations is concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly emphasized the fundamental importance of freedom of expression in a democratic society:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of (democratic) society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of every man. Subject to article 10(2), it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favorably received or regarded as an offensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society. Let there be due process of the law. In the mean time let us enhance human rights education at all levels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Independent Amharic weekly Tobia newspaper yesterday suspended publication in protest against the detention of four of its top editors. AKPAC, the firm publishing the paper, last Thursday indicated that it would suspend the weekly publication indefinitely--but still publish the monthly magazine--if the issue was not resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Human Rights Council(EHRCO) 14 January expressed its concern over the arrest of Tobia's editors. The first to be taken in was the paper's editor, Ato Taye Belachew, detained on November 22 1996. Deputy editor Anteneh Merid was detained three days later. According to Tobia, the two were charged in connection with articles on Tobia's magazine written by an Ethiopian scientist in the United States entitled &quot;A strategy to Unite Eritrea with Ethiopia&quot;.They both appeared in court on 6 December but did not appear before a judge because 'the court would only see cases for which previous adjournments had been made,' said EHRCO. They returned to prison without appearing before a judge a further two times, before doing so for the first time on 16 December. Upon the request of the Investigation Department, reported EHRCO, the two were remanded until 23 December. Both on the 27 and 30 December, they returned to prison without appearing in court because the panel of judges was incomplete. According to Tobia, they have yet to appear before a judge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third to be arrested was Ato Goshu Moges. He had replaced Ato Taye, and was taken in on 12 December. He is supposedly charged in connection with an article on the recent hijacking of Ethiopian flight 961, said Tobia. When he appeared in court eight days later, the court accepted the police's request for a remand until 3 January 1997. Ato Arega Wolde Quirqos, who took over from Ato Goshu was detained 6 January. Both have yet to appear in court to have their cases heard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individuals.&quot; This appears to be the second incident in less than a week to have occured, highlighting a possible division within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first occasion was a shooting in the St. Estifanos Church Thursday 9 January, which resulted in the death of hermit G/Selassie. According to a BBC report, the hermit was killed while trying to give a petition to the Patriarch. The hermit was believed to have been shot by someone from the patriarch's group, said BBC. Patriarch Paolos was also present during the ceremony in the St. Yohannes Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heads of churches and monastries met at the auditorium of the Holy Synod Saturday to condemn the shooting as an attempt on the life of Patrairch Paolos.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Victories by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on the border with Ethiopia and in the Blue Nile Region has prompted the Sudanese government to accuse Ethiopia of helping the rebels. Sudanese girls, most probably students aged around fifteen, marched through the streets of Khartoum yesterday. The girls, new recruits into the Popular Defence Force (PDF) chanted slogans to the effect that they were going to destroy the 'Ethiopian in the East', reported BBC. The Khartoum government closed down the university to make it easier to recruit fighters and issued a Jihad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs however, denied the allegation adding that, &quot;No one knows better than the Sudanese authorities themselves that the accusation has no bases and that Ethiopia has no hand in what is obviously a military setback suffered by the authorities in Khartoum.&quot; The statement issued by the ministry 14 January said that, &quot;It is to be expected that this accusation would be taken by the National Islamic Front Government to the Security Council with the additional aim of diverting the attention of the Council from the unfinished business before it in connection with a proven case of state sponsored terrorism and an assassination attempt by Sudanese authorities against a head of state.&quot; The statement ended with the warning,&quot; It is time for the Sudanese authorities to realise that they cannot always succeed to fool others, and stop believing that fabrications accompanied with great fanfare would be given the benefit of the doubt and some credence by the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified 8 January all Sudanese diplomats in Addis Ababa that they were no longer allowed to go outside the city. According to the government English daily, Ethiopian Herald, the move came in response to a &quot;provocative and malicious&quot; statement made by Mr. Ali Hassan Ali, the Sudan Charge d'Affaires to Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its letter to the Sudanese government, the ministry accused Mr. Ali of having, &quot;Urged Somalis to take up arms and fight Ethiopia in a Jihad (holy war) to counter the recent operation by Ethiopian armed forces against the fundamentalist Al-Ithad Al-Islam group&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter noted that the statement made by Mr. Ali was seen as &quot;a hostile act directed against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia and as such would like to request the Government of the Sudan to disassociate itself from the provocative statement by its diplomat in Mogadishu.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Quoting &quot;Addis Lisan&quot;, the press organ of Region 14 Administration (read Addis Ababa), &quot;Addis Zemen&quot;, the government-owned Amharic daily newspaper, disclosed in its January 10 edition that detailed studies are being conducted on thirty-thousand hectares of land in preparation for use by private developers and investors and by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Addis Zemen&quot; stated in one of its paragraphs on the topic that the thirty- thousand hectares of land had been prepared for private-sector and government development projects while in another paragraph it disclosed that detailed studies were being conducted, which would imply that the land is not really ready for use yet. Apparently in conformity with the latter statement, the Amharic daily said: &quot;Although the city's Master Plan has enough information to indicate the city's future growth directions, there are no detailed plans showing the various specific development projects to be implemented in specific areas, thus necessitating a more detailed study which has been undertaken&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question here is: are the detailed studies in the process of being carried out or have they been completed? this is important, because if they are not completed, we may have to wait years before land distribution for development (on whatever basis) is started! It was further disclosed that the total area of the city of Addis Ababa is 52,000 hectares of which 22,000 hectares have already been utilized.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the latest count, the population of Addis stands at about 2.3 million.  One hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters, which means the total area of Addis Ababa is 520,000,000 square meters. Let us assume an average family size of 5 for Addis which would imply a total number of families of 460,000 for the total population of 2.3 million given above. Divide 520,000,000 square meters by 460,000 and that would yield a potential land holding of about 1130 square meters per family! Wow! That is a lot of land for a single family if only we could lay our hands on it! but why is there so much land and housing shortage in Addis Ababa? Why are tens of thousands people landless and homeless in Addis? Why are house rents skyrocketing? why are land prices soaring into the stratosphere? Why? Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait a minute. We can do a little more arithmetic on the 30,000 hectares of land still initialized in Addis And the total number of housing units (about 380,000) in the city. the 30,000 hectares are equal to 300,000,000 square meters. Assuming that each housing unit on average accommodates 5 persons or one family (or household), the total number of persons who have no shelter or are living in overcrowded conditions may be roughly estimated at 400,000 (i.e.  460,000 - 380,000 times 5) or 80,000 families or households. Divide the still initialized 300,000,000 square meters of land in Addis Ababa by these 80,000 families. It works out at 3750 square meters per family!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, there is plenty of land for everybody in Addis Ababa. On a purely per capita basis each person who has no housing or is living in overcrowded conditions can have as much as 750 square meters of land! This, of course, would not be realistic as a lot of land would be needed for industry and other enterprises, for government offices, road construction, schools, hospitals, sports grounds, parks, etc. Even then, a lot of this land would be required and utilized by private individuals in a professedly market-and private-property-based economy. The point at issue is that, contrary to common perceptions, there is a lot of land in Addis that is simply sitting idle, and the reason why land prices are so high at percent is clearly because of the government's monopoly on land ownership and the very inefficient manner of its distribution through the highly controversial land- lease mechanism! Why, may we ask should 250 square meters of land with a chicken coop on it cost 100,000 birr in a city where the average annual income (for those lucky enough to be employed) is no more than 2000 birr! For the purpose of comparison, even people with annual average incomes of 18,000 birr cannot afford such high land prices in their lifetimes! (Note: since all land is state-owned in Ethiopia, land on the free market is evasively sold by purporting to sell some cheap physical structures put on it).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, may we ask, should a modest villa cost 500,000 birr here in Addis? Why should it be so difficult to find housing to rent? Why is it an up-hill task to find office space? Why are no trees being planted on the outskirts of Addis or animals not being bred? Why are business enterprises not being set up as fast as they could be? Why should land lease fees rise as high as 10 million birr for a 200-square-meter piece of land in the midst of 300,000,000 million square meters of still initialized land in Addis Ababa? A riddle? Of course not, it is a clear as daylight. The problem lies in the government's land policy which may be broken down into three salient features: one is that only the state can own land: the second feature is that it cannot be bought or sold; and the third one is that it can be distributed (or made available) to users only through the land-lease mechanism. What this amounts to in the case of Addis Ababa is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the 300,000,000 square meters of initialized land cannot be owned by private individuals or entities;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* all this land can neither be sold nor bought;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the land can be made available to users only through the land-lease mechanism, which has so far released only a very limited amount of land per year;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* parts of already settled lands cannot be sold by private occupants because land cannot be bought or sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What all this means is quite clear. Potential private developers do not have access to land. Because the land-lease mechanism releases land on a very piecemeal basis, the artificial land shortage so created escalates, as it has very clearly done so far, land prices beyond everybody's reach. No ready access to land means no accelerated economic development and this means not enough new jobs and not enough new incomes, implying the worsening of poverty levels already badly aggravated by relentless population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to do? What to do is quite obvious. Even employing its land-lease policy, the government can very substantially improve access to land in Addis Ababa. (the author of this article is, however, of the opinion that the land- lease mechanism should only be one among several mechanisms of land distribution, including outright private ownership either through sale or grant). At any rate, here are a few general tips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* clear satisfactorily any legal claims on the 300,000,000 square meters of initialized land;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* set up a land administration authority with a land distribution committee in each of the city's woredas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* start distributing land in each woreda on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government, please let go of all that idle land! We want to create value on it and make ourselves and the country prosperous. We could do a thousand and one things with the land including the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* build houses for ourselves and for rent. We promise we will almost get rid of the housing shortage in three years;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* put up all sorts of business enterprises;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* build private schools, hospitals and clinics;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* plant trees and breed animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of how substantially an unemployed man's life would be transformed if such a measure is taken. As a result of the highly increased economic activity in the city, he would find the highly increased economic activity in the city, he would find a job and earn an income; he would have a wide choice of houses to rent or may acquire land to put up his own house; he could now form a family and enjoy its warmth and affection; good food (including meat, milk and vegetables) would be available at a competitive price; he could send his children to private schools; with all these blessings, he would tend to be productive and efficient in his work, and be filled with hope and inspiration about his future! A once wretched unemployed man would be transformed into a cheerful and amicable human being, radiating warmth and hope to all those surrounding him! Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing to help bring about!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - We saw last week that Menilek, mainly after his victory at the battle of Adwa in 1896, began Ethiopia's modernisation. Now read on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important development of this period was the introduction, by whom is uncertain, of the Australian eucalyptus tree. Some of the first plants were reportedly planted by Menilek's French adviser, Casimir Mondon-Vidailhet, in 1894 or 1895. The tree grew so fast that it was soon extensively cultivated in Addis Ababa. Some landowners planted large eucalyptus forests on their estates, and thereby solved the capital's hitherto serious shortage of both timber and fire-wood. The eucalyptus tree was, however, a thirsty plant, which dried up rivers and wells, and, by restricting grass cover, increased soil erosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Crucial Importance for Addis Ababa</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coming of the eucalyptus was of crucial importance in the history of Addis Ababa. The town's shortage of wood had been so acute that Menilek, in 1900, had actually envisaged abandoning the capital in favour of a settlement 55 kilometres to the west, which Taytu named Addis Alam, literally New World.  The eucalyptus tree, however, grew so fast that the Emperor, in the following year, abandoned the plan to transfer the capital. The move had in any case been strongly opposed by most of the foreign legations, as well as by some of the nobles. Both had invested heavily in Addis Ababa buildings, and were reluctant to see them abandoned. Almost the only support for the Addis Alam project came, curiously, from Italy, which, wishing to please the monarch, went so far as to erect a Legation at the new site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Russian Red Cross Hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's first modern hospital meanwhile was set up in 1896, immediately after the battle of Adwa, by a Russian Red Cross mission. It had been despatched, by the slow-moving authorities in St Petersburg, to treat Ethiopians wounded in the fighting, but, arriving after the conclusion of hostilities, established itself in the capital instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The First Roads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first years of the twentieth century, the period of peace, that is, after the battle of Adwa, witnessed the construction of Ethiopia's first two modern roads. One, built with the help of Italian engineers, linked Addis Ababa with Addis Alam. The other, constructed, with the assistance of French technicians working on the railway, ran from the old emporium of Harar to the new railway town of Dire Dawa. A shipping service, linking Gambla on the Baro river, a tributary of the Nile in west, with Khartoum in Sudan, came into existence shortly afterwards, in 1907.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank of Abyssinia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the next few years, the last of Menilek's reign, a succession of modern establishments came into existence. The first, set up by imperial charter in 1905, was the Bank of Abyssinia. An affiliate of the British-owned National Bank of Egypt, it was run largely under the supervision of British staff. The Bank of Abyssinia was engaged in most ordinary aspects of banking, but also handled most of the Emperor's commercial affairs, which were largely undifferentiated from those of the Ethiopian state. The bank was also responsible for the issue of the country's currency, including the issue of paper money, inaugurated in 1914-15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Etege Hotel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's first government hotel, founded by Empress Taytu, and known as the Et&lt;130ge, literally Queen, was established in 1907. It was such a novelty that Menilek's chronicler, drawing a distinction with the free hospitality traditionally afforded at state banquets and those of the nobility, found it necessary to explain that guests had to pay for what they consumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Copts, and the Menilek School</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first modern school, the Menilek II School, which taught in French, was founded by the Emperor in 1908. Having to contend with Church opposition to Western ideas, he entrusted it, and three others in the provinces, at Harar, Ankobar and Das, to Egyptian Coptic teachers, to whom the local priesthood, and their Egyptian Coptic head, Abuna Matewos, could raise no objection.  Earlier, with Ilg's help, Menilek had despatched three youngsters in 1894 for study in Switzerland. Others were later sent to Russia, which was selected as an Orthodox Christian country, like Ethiopia, with strong monarchical traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Menilek Hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first Ethiopian Government hospital, the Menilek II, was established in 1910, with the assistance of several foreign doctors. Some of them, including several German specialists, had come to treat the Emperor, who was then mortally ill. The establishment was located on the site of the earlier Russian Red Cross hospital, which had ceased functioning a few years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Newspaper &quot;Aymro&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A State printing press was set up in 1911. It was used for the publication of the first real Amharic newspaper, &quot;Aymro&quot;, as well as various decrees and other official documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several small-scale industrial enterprises were likewise established at this time, among them a hydro-electric plant and a cartridge factory, both at Aqaqi, and saw-mills in the Managasha forest, west of Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Water Worships Menilek&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another innovation was a water pipe, which ran from the Entotto mountains, above the town, to the palace compound. The latter was situated on elevated ground, so that the water had to travel upwards for part of its journey. This at first created considerable amazement, and caused a poet to exclaim that &quot; even water worshipped Menilek&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting to Work on Time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large clock, one metre square, was later installed above one of the palace buildings. It was visible from afar, and chimed every hour, thus, it is reported, enabling the citizens, perhaps for the first time in their lives, to go to work on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New, and More Commercialised Way of Life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early years of the century also coincided with the expansion of Addis Ababa. The city, after the coming of the railway, grew rapidly, and developed an increasingly commercialised way of life. Innovations included stone buildings, which replaced wattle and daub huts; corrugated iron roofing, which replaced thatch; and mechanical grain grinding-mills, which replaced pestles and mortars worked by hand. Among other developments mentioned may be made of the setting up of bakeries, for the manufacture of European-type loaves, which were beginning to be eaten instead of, or as well as, enjera, the traditional Ethiopian-type bread; the sale of enjara, which had formerly been made only at home for family use; butchers' shops, for a population which had hitherto slaughtered its own livestock; hotels, restaurants, and drinking houses, for paying customers, who had previously eaten and drunk at home, or in other people's houses as non-paying guests; and commercial, in many cases open-air, tailors' shops, instead of traditional hand sewing.  These shops often made use of Singer sewing machines, imported from the United States, and acquired by the tailors on very convenient hire-purchase terms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Assuming political power by election or by force may be personally highly gratifying. The person who so assumes power feels good and improves his or her social and economic standing. With political power, the prospect of caring well for one's family or helping friends, relatives and kith and kin in general becomes even more real and tangible. With all this comes prestige and one's ego is pleasantly puffed although oftentimes this is taken to extremes and may result in feelings of self-deceptive grandeur.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on the specific personality type (this may be partly be gene- determined) of the persona who achieves political power, the saying that &quot; power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot; holds strikingly true in a large number of instances, especially in underdeveloped countries. With decisive political power, one's command over goods, services and over people increases immensely, and needless to say, in the case of absolute power, this command increases absolutely. Without a tempering contemplative bent, such excessive power over goods, services and people inculcates in the mind such a strong feeling of superiority that the person in question may actually fall into the delusion of thinking himself to be next only to God and that the rest of humanity is destined to be the riff-raff! The proximate psychological theory here would be that human behavior is a function of power and wealth.  In some personality types who have achieved near absolute power, the mental faculty of conscience may be so weakened that basic moral principles may be violated without the slightest feeling of compunction. It is to curb these untoward human behavioral tendencies that democracy, however imperfect, was invented!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy has helped, however imperfectly, to shift the focus of politics from self-aggrandizement to service one's people and country. In an elective political system, power is given to the elected on the electoral judgment that they will serve the people and the country much more than they serve themselves. If this basic electoral condition is not met, then democracy ensures that the elected are peacefully removed from power through the elective process. Because this is often the case in democratic societies, political power under such circumstances is prevented from becoming an end in itself. The elected are expected, at the risk of being removed from office if they fail, to work towards helping improve the lives of their subjects and the economic, defence and diplomatic status of their respective countries. Of particular importance in this connection is economic development. It is well- established all around the democratic world that the health of the national economy is the most important single political issue at election time. In these democratic countries (the adjective here is used in reactive terms), uppermost in the minds of elected leaders is: in what way can we employ our political power to bring about further economic prospective so that we may be elected again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, in most countries where political power is attained by force, the question foremost in the minds of leaders is: how can we use the political power we have attained to stay in power? Here power attempts to perpetuate itself by force and thus becomes an end in itself, sidelining the objective of service to people and country. It is worth noting at this ponit that the issue of economic growth and development in politics is so important that leaders who have seized power by force but who have used political power not only to perpetuate themselves in power but also to improve the economic lot of their peoples in tangible ways have succeeded in substantially improving their political credibility and legitimacy, despite the undemocratic manner in which they assumed power in the first place. This we may call &quot;enlightened undemocratic power&quot; which uses the advancement of the common good as an additional means of perpetuating itself. Enlightened undemocratic power indirectly indicates that politics without economics is really empty at the national level. Unenlightened and undemocratic political power has no legitimacy of existence from the point of view of subjects and country. Hence, in underdeveloped countries, where democratic traditions and institutions are still at an early stage of evolution, the enlightened yet undemocratic political power system may be favorably considered as a second- best option. Accordingly, using national economic prosperity as a means of gaining political credibility should be looked upon as a respectable method of perpetuating power. It would thus become important to examine what this consists in. Put simply, the most important economic objective here would be to make every citizen a productive agent to the extent the subject's potentialities permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A human being who does not possess some productive capacity is a burden to society and to himself (or herself). However, access to productive capacity is not wholly under the control of the individual. The individual may be disabled by nature; the place of birth may determine access to education, health and other basic facilities; one's family background can impose constraints on individual capacity-building; access to land and credit may not be fairly distributed across the population. The remark would quickly be made which would point out: but nature is often unfair; so is life in that the status quo is already replete which all of these inequalities. Man is part of nature which is often unfair. How do you expect man (who is part of nature) to be always fair? We already have different classes of people such as the educated and the uneducated; the sick and the healthy; those who have land and cash and those who have little of these or none. What to do? The simple answer here would be: let the advantaged classes continue to have more access to land, credit, education and the other basic facilities and become more and more productive so that, as de facto custodians of the productive forces of the country, they may create the rest of society in their own image, which means pulling their compatriots on to the path of prosperity, which they themselves have long treaded proudly. In more specific terms, their expansion and new investment projects would create hundreds of thousands of jobs for the unemployed. This would give the poor access to income, which means access to basic nutrition, shelter, education and health care, the very ingredients necessary to progressively attain the objective of making every citizen a productive agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government should play a catalytic role in this general process. It should facilitate the productive economic activities of the advantaged classes; at the same time, it should carry out special programmes designed to assist the disadvantaged classes, who in Ethiopia are the majority, in their attempt to become productive agents. To this end: basic education and health facilities should be expanded through the country; state-owned land should be distributed free or at a nominal fee to the landless who show premise of being productive; and attempts should be made to make credit available to the poor through micro-credit institutions. All this is to be done at a measured pace and not as some frenzied populist campaign, as is often the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us take two examples to show the role of the government in Ethiopia's professedly market-based economy; one associated with a poor, unemployed male person (PUMP) and another with his rich counterpart (RC)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP to Government: Please give me a job so I can have income with which to buy food and clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: There are millions of people like you but we can only give limited assistance through our poverty alleviation programmes. You look pretty able-bodied. Do you have land?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Do you have any money at all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: I am down to my last 10 birr of the little money my relatives back home gave me for food until I find a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Where are your relatives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: In the countryside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Why did you come to Addis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: There is a land shortage in our locality, Besides, friends told me I could improve my lot in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Do you still think you can improve your lot in Addis? How long have you been in Addis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: There is a lot of wealth here although there are a lot of desperately poor people as well. It has been over a year since I came to Addis, but I still think I'd rather be here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Have you got children?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: Yes. Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: How can you have that many children when you don't even have enough to eat? Where is your wife?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: It is God's will that a man should be joined with a woman and that they should bear children, as many as God's will. How can man interfere with what has been ordained by the Almighty? Did you ask about my wife?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, she ran to Addis Ababa, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: We can't argue with that, but God did give you basic intelligence and knowledge to decide when it is right to have children and when it is not. What is the sense in having children if you can't even feed them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: O.K., now give me a job so I can feed them!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: We will give you two options: one is to go to Wellega where you will be granted one hectare of land free in just one week as private property.  You can buy oxen on credit. The other is to stay on in Addis with you name registered with one of the new private investors for a non-clerical job. It may be a long wait before anything concrete turns up!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUMP: I'll take the second choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Well, it is up to you. Pay us a visit at the employment exchange in Arat Kilo. Good day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter PUMP's rich counterpart (RC)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Nice to see you. Anything we can do to help you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RC: Hello, government, Nice to see you too. I am planning to start a horticultural farm in Hararge, catering mainly for the export market. The idea is to grow high-quality fruits, vegetables and flowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: Exports! That's the best news we've had all morning! Exports, the lifeblood of our national economy! We give all investors, foreign as well as domestic, royal treatment. How can we help?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RC: I need at least one &quot;gasha&quot; of land to start the project on an experimental basis. I have located a suitable area in Harar with no legal complications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: No problem. You can have it on lease or buy it outright if you like. The whole paper work will take no more than five working days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RC: &lt;NI will buy it. Here is a down-payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government: &lt;NWe will find out the exact location of the land and its legal status and let you know this afternoon. You will have the title deed in five days. Will you do us a favor, though. There is an unemployed, able-bodied man who would like to be registered with you for a non-clerical job in the future head-office of your farm enterprise, which we believe will be here in Addis.  There is just a matter of competitive recruitment procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RC: I will be perfectly happy to do that. What is his name?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, in nutshell, is how government power (political power) should be used in Ethiopia. There is no justification for political power in a developing country if it cannot bring about an economic transformation. Let us use political power like it is used in Singapore, a nation-state, small though it may be, that has, in the span of no more than thirty years, surpassed its former colonial master, Great Britain, in per capita income! Incredible, but true! By contrast, look at Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi or Afghanistan! Indeed, politics is hollow without economic development!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Ethiopia has around forty-five graduate lawyers, with an average of five graduating annually, according to W/t Meaza Ashenafi, president and one of the fifteen original founders of the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association. For Meaza, 32, law was her first choice when she was accepted by the Addis Ababa University--but only because her big sister persuaded her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1985, Meaza graduated from university -- the only female in her class.  She joined the Ministry of Trade for two years. &quot;It was OK,&quot; she remembers, &quot; I was working as a junior expert in the commercial area-looking at the commercial code. I can't say that was my particular interest because I am not interested in business law. When I rediscovered myself now, I am more interested in humanitarian law.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meaza then worked for the Ministry of Justice for the next three years.  Assigned to the criminal division, originally she worked with two other judges presiding over serious crime cases. She was slightly uncomfortable with her role and differed in opinion with her two colleagues over convicting people. &quot;They did not mind imprisoning people for fifteen years,&quot; she explained, &quot;but I was very reluctant to give people the maximum penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then she was assigned to a division where she worked alone presiding over cases involving criminal cases such as rape on appeal, murder by negligence.  The freedom to pass judgment without compromising herself did bring with it its own hassles, as she was soon to learn. A case she particularly remembers involved a guard in some high school that was robbed while he was on duty.  His son, who had been with Meaza in the university, came to her and explained that his father was the sole supporter of eight children. Meaza told him she could not influence the verdict to suit his father. Unfortunately, the case went against the man and he was imprisoned. &quot;After I read the verdict I went back to my chambers and the son followed me. He cried, and I cried too. I told him I understood his position but there was nothing I could do. I then offered to give him some money each month to help support his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After working in the courts, she joined the Ethiopian Constitution Commission for the next three years. There she did research and comparative study on different constitutions, and advised the commission's human rights panel. &quot;I have done research on the South African, Ugandan, Indian Constitution, and international conventions, I think our Constitution is a combination of these ones. I think most of the wording is taken from the human rights and international conventions. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she left the commission, Meaza, along with fifteen other women lawyers, formed the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA). Meaza, now president of EWLA, estimates that the majority of women graduate lawyers are members of the association--with some female law students joining as associate members.  One aim of EWLA is, she explained, to encourage girls to go to law school. &quot; Actually, &quot;she added, &quot;the law school has asked me to give paralegal training to law students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of the EWLA however, remains representing women in court. There are great difficulties in practicing law in the country. &quot;For one,&quot; remarked Meaza, &quot;the courts are not functioning properly. People are not encouraged to go to court. If we had to compare our laws as they exist and its implementation,&quot; she said &quot;then the implementation is a very serious problem.&quot; This is not a problem unique to Ethiopia, according to Meaza, but is shared by other third world countries where, &quot;administration apparatus of the government is weak, the implementation of laws are also clumsy. Particularly as regards to women's rights. Although the Constitution provides very well for the protection of women's rights, other subordinate laws have yet to be corrected. In addition, there is the problem with the enforcement mechanism.  One is capacity, the other attitudinal problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have recently submitted some amendments to the parliament. We have asked that some corrections be made on some laws and some laws be done away with completely. One such law was the equality regarding age of marriage. The civil law says the minimum age of marriage for girls is fifteen and for boys eighteen, and we demand that it should be corrected. It is discriminatory, and we do not believe a child of fifteen has the capacity to give consent.  Another provision is, the law only gives three-months maintenance for a woman who has been living in a union without concluding a marriage. Even though we do not claim that the law should provide equal protection as in marriage, we feel that women who have been living in such a union should be entitled to a certain amount of property rights--because they have been investing in that union for a long time.&quot; Another law that EWLA is against is&lt;Nthe one saying &quot; that administration of common property is the sole right of the husband&quot; Meaza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarking on the types of cases handled by the EWLA, Meaza said, it was mostly rape, property division, child maintenance, and divorce. &quot;Assault is not reported,&quot; she said, adding that in accordance with the law, &quot;assault could be prosecuted, but the law says something and in practice it is another matter. Whenever a woman goes to the police and reports a violation by her husband, they tell her 'it is a domestic matter you should be able to settle it by yourself'. They were supposed to investigate.&quot; Meaza Ashenafi is single, and likes swimming and exercising. &quot;By being a lawyer,&quot; she noted, &quot;I feel that I am contributing a lot to the society. Particularly with the work I am doing right now, I feel a lot of satisfaction. I feel a deep sense of gratification you cannot imagine. You might be frustrated sometimes because you might be in a position where you cannot help people--given the situation, the male dominance, and everything. But you feel very happy that you could allow people to come and talk to you. Because talking and crying are a process of healing for women. They cannot get this from a lawyer--even if they can afford to pay. When you go to a legal office, you are asked to talk about your case and leave. But here we allow them we allow them to talk and encourage them. This makes me feel good in what I do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Dr Alex Boraine, vice chairperson, TRC, January 20, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am concerned at press reports in which General Steyn is alleged to have denied certain facts included in the TRC'S press release on Thursday 16 January 1997. He has been most cooperative in assisting us to understand the nature of his report to former President de Klerk, and we are in direct touch with him to clarify the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the seriousness of the matter it is necessary at this stage, however, to clarify the following matters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The press statement of last Thursday entitled &quot;Basis of media briefing on the meeting between Genl. Steyn and the TRC&quot; was released after careful consultation with General Steyn and after certain amendments suggested by him were added to the statement. This was to ensure that no possible misunderstandings or incorrect information be communicated to the public. The statement was released to the media with his full knowledge and support. We stand by that statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. We have examined General's Steyn's written statement issued on Friday and we see no fundamental conflicts between the two statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. We re-iterate that the Commission received from General Steyn a written document, which includes a staff report of the matter under investigation and a matrix containing the names of a number of people under suspicion, which was handed to the former President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The findings in this documentation are at the level of intelligence reports. As such they are not conclusive - a matter which was made absolutely clear at our press conference. It is for this reason that General Steyn urged the former President not to take specific action without further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. It is the task of our investigative unit and research department to investigate thoroughly all information which we receive, for this to be corroborated and cross-checked. I wish to reiterate that the information contained in the file handed to us by General Steyn is an invaluable source of information, which we take into account in our ongoing decisions concerning future subpoenas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. We have in our possession, inter alia, a letter addressed by General Steyn to former President de Klerk, written subsequent to his initial report, in which General Steyn again draws to the former President's attention the substance of the information given to him earlier. This intensifies our concern that the former President appeared not to have taken sufficient steps either to investigate or counter allegations of third force activities within the SADF and SAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A new development in this saga confirms our reservations. It is now reported that Colonel Roelf Venter, who in an amnesty application to the TRC has claimed to have been involved in a range of state-initiated criminal activities, was later assigned together with Brigadier Suiker Brits, to investigate the allegations identified in General Steyn's report. If true, this emphasises our concern that the allegations of dirty tricks by SADF personnel may not have been adequately investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In summation, we reiterate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The existence of a written report, which was seen by former President de Klerk;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that three generals whose names appeared in the report given by Genl. Steyn to the former President, were asked by President De Klerk to recommend the names of those against whom action should take place; and 3.  The failure over a nine-month period to investigate adequately the charges against those mentioned in the report who were allegedly involved in third force activities in the SADF and SAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATEMENT BY DR ALEX BORAINE, VICE-CHAIRPERSON OF THE TRC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 16, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has established conclusively the existence of a written report produced by General Pierre Steyn's 1992 investigations into intelligence activity in the former South African Defence Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TRC's Research Department has established that while, technically speaking, there was no formal report produced by General Steyn, his verbal briefing of former President F W de Klerk and senior members of his Cabinet was substantiated by a &quot;staff report&quot; comprising written notes and a diagram.  The report was made available to Mr de Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Steyn, now Secretary of Defence, has provided the Research Department with a large file containing information, including the &quot;staff report&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attached briefing from the Research Department summarises its work so far. Of particular note are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The fact that Mr De Klerk's drastic action in dismissing or retiring a range of military personnel in December 1992 was taken without the full investigation which General Steyn had recommended in his report;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. General Steyn's concern at the lack of progress in investigations carried out after the dismissals and compulsory retirements, and his view that the SAP and SADF at the time were spending more time on cover-ups and identifying leaks than gathering evidence;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The fact that documents were destroyed throughout his investigation, in defiance of his orders;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That intelligence gathered by General Steyn's inquiries indicated significant unauthorised and unlawful actions, involving not only the Directorate of Covert Collection of the SADF but several other components of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Research Department is continuing its work in this area. The Commission will not release General Steyn's report for two reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. More than 60 names of individuals are listed in the documentation that General Steyn made available to the Research Department, and allegations against many have not been substantiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Commission is concerned that its investigations should not be prejudiced before they are completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BASIS OF MEDIA BRIEFING ON THE MEETING BETWEEN GEN PIERRE STEYN AND THE TRC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Compiled by TRC Research Department; attribute to Prof Charles Villa- Vicencio, Director of Research)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TRC approached General Pierre Steyn, now Secretary of Defence, to make known to it the nature and substance of his briefing of Former President FW de Klerk on his investigation into intelligence activities in the SADF and whether the Directorate of Covert Collection contravened the law or government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Steyn briefed members of the TRC on 10 October 1996, providing the TRC with a file, containing information gathered during his enquiry. Included in the file was a &quot;staff report&quot; (&quot;Stafgeskrif&quot;) comprising notes and a matrix (diagram) containing activities, components and the names of individuals in the SADF suspected of engaging in unauthorised and/or unlawful actions. These notes and the matrix were used in the verbal briefing of the former President and senior members of his Cabinet in December 1992, and were made available to the President. The substance of this report was that intelligence gathered indicated significant unauthorised and unlawful actions, involving several components of the SADF and the SAP, and not just the Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC). However, this remained at the level of intelligence information and General Steyn strongly recommended that the former President appoint an immediate criminal investigation either to substantiate or deny the information which he had placed at the former President's disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former President handed the document to Generals Kat Liebenberg, George Meiring and Joffel van der Westhuizen soon after receiving it, requiring them to provide him with a list of persons who should be dismissed or retired from the SADF. The investigation recommended by General Steyn did not take place before this happened. These names were extracted from a wide-ranging list of names, which included those with line responsibility as well as some possibly more directly involved in irregularities, in the documentation which General Steyn made available to the former President. This documentation included no recommendation either to dismiss or retire any military personnel without further investigation - making the drastic action taken by the former President most unusual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President de Klerk called a press conference at which he announced the retirement and dismissal of a total of 23 SADF members. With the support of the Ministers of the Justice and Police, he also authorised General Steyn to make the report available to a team of criminal investigators under the direction of the Attorney-General of the Transvaal and the Attorney-General of the Witwatersrand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Steyn made several further reports, both verbal and written, to the former President de Klerk and the Minister of Defence, Mr Kobie Coetzee, during 1993. In all these reports he reiterated the need for further criminal investigation and expressed his concern about the lack of progress. General Steyn's view was that more effort was being expended by the SAP and SADF on 'covering up' and 'identifying leaks' than on gathering evidence. Despite his orders at the start of his investigation that no documentation should be destroyed without his express permission, he was informed by the then NIS that the destruction of documents continued throughout his investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement from the Truth And Reconciliation Commission, January 17, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors have discovered cancer in Archbishop Desmond Tutu's prostate gland but will take some weeks to establish how serious it is and whether it has spread beyond the prostate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been revealed by test results which became available after the release last night of a statement on Archbishop Tutu's condition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The statement indicated that no malignancy had been discovered in initial tests.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial procedure carried out by the specialists who treated the Archbishop on Wednesday involved a simple biopsy. An examination of tissue from the periphery of the prostate by microscope revealed no sign of cancer.  The Archbishop's urologist then proceeded with a full prostate operation and removed the bulk of the prostate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further tests were carried out on the removed tissue. The results of these tests have indicated a definite cancer of the prostate but further tests will be needed to determine its extent and its seriousness. There is nothing to suggest cancer outside the prostate at this stage but only tests will determine this accurately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The urologist does not believe it helpful to become involved in speculative comment about the prognosis or the implications of results received so far.  Bulletins will be issued when further test results become available.</SPAN></P>

Impact of drought in the north-east a) Prolonged drought in the north- eastern have been compounded by a failure of the long-rains (March-May) of 1996 and very late and insufficient precipitation during the 1996 short-rains season just ended. b) These conditions in the north-eastern regions have led to increases in wholesale maize prices, a spread in the incidence of malnutrition, further loss of livestock, and a rise in population movement in search of water, pasture and relief aid. c) WFP has been requested by the Government of Kenya to provide relief food for six months for 275,000 pre- primary and primary school children and for 225,000 other drought victims in the affected areas. The total number of people affected in the north-eastern and eastern regions is 1.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. ZAIRE - most information as of 16 January 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) UN agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) continue to assist Rwandan and Burundian refugees in makeshift settlements in eastern Zaire.  Refugees are located in Tingi Tingi and Amisi (located near Lubutu, south- east of Kisangani, in the direction of Goma and Bukavu), and in Shabunda (west of Bukavu). These refugees are mostly from the Bukavu and Uvira camps; unlike their North Kivu counterparts these refugees were not able to return to Rwanda immediately following the ADFL offensive. Uvira and Bukavu refugees were instead pursued by ADFL rebels westward, deeper into the Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Kisangani, Amisi and Tingi Tingi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) During the week of 6 to 12 January, the security situation in Kisangani improved relative to the previous week. A curfew continues in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Reports from Kisangani as of 16 January indicated that Tingi Tingi and Lubutu were calm however rumours of fighting east of Tingi Tingi have caused tension among refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) The WFP-chartered Boeing 707 continues to fly to Kisangani. A total of 451 metric tons of foodstuff were airlifted to Kisangani from 6 to 12 January.  During the same period, 72 metric tons were airlifted to Tingi Tingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) WFP suspended all relief flights to Amisi and Tingi Tingi from Kisangani between 14 and 16 January following an incident on 14 January in which armed men and refugees in Amisi tried to hijack an aircraft carrying WFP food commodities. The plane was later able to return to Kisangani. Flights resumed on 17 January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e) With the exception of the days on which flights were suspended, WFP is providing an estimated 80 percent of the food needs of the refugee population, is estimated at 160,000, through deliveries by air and overland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">f) In Tingi Tingi, WFP is delivering maize meal and high-protein biscuits to therapeutic and supplementary feeding programmes run by MSF and UNICEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Shabunda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) UNHCR/WFP/UNICEF mission visited Shabunda on 14 and 15 January. The security situation was reported as calm. The mission located three spontaneous settlements between 3 and 13 km outside of Shabunda: Makese 1, with an estimated population of 6,000 to 7,000 Rwandan refugees; Makese 2, with an estimated population of 3,000 Burundian refugees; and Kabakita, with an estimated population of 20,000 Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) The mission brought with them to Shabunda one metric ton of UNIMIX for distribution to unaccompanied children. On 15 January, a UN DC-3 aircraft landed in Shabunda with another 500 kg of UNIMIX and one metric ton of WFP maize flour. The commodities are being kept at a warehouse. Distribution of the food aid will be carried out by the NGO called E Doctors, with the assistance of two WFP local staff currently at Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) WFP is working with other UN agencies, ICRC and local authorities to ensure necessary security before initiating further food assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Goma: On 7 January, North Kivu authorities opened the Bunagana entry point to public access, following the lifting of Uganda's border restrictions.  The Ishasha border crossing remains closed. Barge services between Goma and Bukavu resumed during the week of 6 to 12 January and local port authorities (SFE) indicated their willingness to cooperate with WFP regarding the transport of commodities between the two ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 The provision of food-aid to returnees continues throughout the country, with some 17,037 metric tons supplied and distributed with NGO partners since the beginning of the operation, in mid-November 1996. This quantity represents 1,134,270 individuals assisted with a monthly ration. Most distributions are carried out at the commune level, to heads of households (occasionally at the sector level).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Following the decision to provide six months of returnee packages instead of two and the decision by the Government that local authorities will carry out the distributions, WFP is discussing with the Government guidelines for local authorities to ensure efficient handling and distribution of WFP commodities and appropriate monitoring and reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 A noticeable increase in repatriation was observed last week from South Kivu (Zaire) when 8,642 returnees came to Rwanda via Cyangugu. WFP has pre- positioned 50 metric tons of biscuits in Cyangugu in case of increased repatriation in the coming week. Repatriation of Rwandan refugees via Goma also continues, with 1,362 persons arriving last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 Mudende camp for Zairean refugees (Gisenyi) has been closed, with all 5, 200 refugees repatriating. Kigeme camp (Gikongoro) which is hosting 1,600 Burundian refugees is also expected to close soon. 277 new refugees arrived from Burundi in Cyangugu last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 The WFP Country Office received an additional 15 trucks (6 metric tons capacity) to be used within the Rwanda operation. The trucks arrived from the SCF/Oxfam Joint Transport Operation in Ethiopia, following an agreement with the Government of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Violent clashes between Hutu extremist faction among the Burundian refugees in Kitali Hills camps in Ngara, resulted in loss of life and severe injuries to some refugees. All efforts are being made to contain the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 From 9 to 14 January, 6,265 refugees crossed the Kigoma region border from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Refugees are also arriving from Burundi, mostly from Ngozi province.  About 210,000 Burundian refugees are presently in Tanzania. The Tanzanian authorities have stated that Burundian refugees who are registered by aid agencies will be allowed to stay. Burundian refugees who were in Benaco camps were relocated and registered in Lukoli camp during the week. More refugees are waiting for the screening exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 UN agencies in Burundi issued a statement through the UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator saying that the embargo on the country &quot;continues to impose severe restrictions on the ability of international humanitarian organisations to provide aid to the country's most vulnerable populations&quot;.  Aid agencies are frustrated with continued difficulties in obtaining permission to import goods necessary for their humanitarian operations, despite their exemption from the sanctions by the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee in September and October 1996. In particular, only a one-month supply of fuel has been imported since an exemption was granted at the beginning of September, resulting in the depletion of fuel stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 The UN statement indicates that if permission to import more fuel is not given soon, emergency relief operations will be further reduced. The Regional Sanctions Committee is not expected to meet before the beginning of February, which is too late to address the serious situation faced by humanitarian agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Permission to transport food relief via Lake Tanganyika from Kigoma was confirmed this week, although there is still some uncertainty as to the attitude of local authorities in Kigoma regarding the use of Burundian- registered barges. WFP intends to ship approximately 1,500 metric tons per month to Bujumbura from Kigoma by barge and to continue to truck 1,000 metric tons per month to Ngozi from Isaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 The Burundi army arrested seven of its soldiers after 122 Burundians expelled by Tanzania were killed at the Kobero border crossing (Muyinga province) last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.5 Insecurity continued in Bujumbura Rural and Bubanza province. In Bujumbura city, a grenade wounded 36 people in a bar. The main road south of Bujumbura (Route Nationale 3) continues to be extremely dangerous. Mines continue to threaten passengers of vehicles on dirt roads in several areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.6 The WFP Burundi caseload totaled 135,237 from 6 to 12 January, of which 60,538 were beneficiaries of emergency relief distributions. The bulk of the emergency assistance went to displaced people in Gitega and Karuzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. KENYA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. IMPACT OF DROUGHT IN THE NORTH-EAST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The north-eastern regions of Kenya have been experiencing severe drought conditions of a prolonged period since the 1992/94 drought. While poor rains were received in the short-rains season (October-December) of 1995, the seasonal long-rains (March-May) of 1996 failed completely. These adverse conditions were followed by very late and totally insufficient precipitation during the 1996 short-rains season just ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 These conditions in the north-eastern regions have led to: (a) Wholesale maize prices increasing (b) Incidence of malnutrition spreading rapidly (c) Loss of livestock continuing due to decreased grazing capacity, and (d) Population movement in search of water, pasture and relief aid being on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The Government of Kenya this month requested WFP to provide relief food to cover about 275,000 pre-primary and primary school children in nine districts and in two divisions of a tenth district. Relief food aid was also requested for a further 225,000 drought victims in the same districts.  Duration of assistance requested by the government is for six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Various organizations have suggested to the government that it give consideration to the lifting of the ban on commercial cereals imports in order to cover the gap between what is available in-country and what is required to cover the basic needs of the estimated 1.6 million drought- affected people in the north-eastern and eastern regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. SUDAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE ON FOOD SUPPLY SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Following Food Availability and Crop Assessment Missions in conjunction with UNICEF and FAO in both the Southern Sector (September 1996) and Northern Sector (November-December 1996), WFP foresees a 1996-97 cereal harvest 50 percent greater than last year and even slightly higher than the excellent 1994-95 crop. The only negative note concerns millet-producing areas which will produce only half of the production of the 1994-95 exceptional year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 As a result WFP plans to provide emergency food assistance only to the Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) areas where continuing conflict prevents 2.6 million from access to food or a livelihood that would enable them to purchase. At the same time, WFP will monitor several areas of Darfur, Kordofan and especially Eastern provinces to ensure that adequate amounts of affordable food will be transferred from surplus-producing areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The 1997 UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for Sudan is currently in preparation and is expected to be presented to the donors in Geneva on 11 February. WFP expects to request food and support costs that will enable the Programme to meet the needs of 2.6 million beneficiaries in displaced camps and in the conflict-affected areas of the transitional zone and the states of Bahr El Ghazel, Upper Nile, Jonglei and Equatoria: an estimated total of 48, 905 metric tons almost equally divided between Northern and Southern sector operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Carry-over and pipeline stocks will already provide 24,780 metric tons, leaving a shortfall of 24,125 metric tons. Total assistance (food, transport and support costs) required for WFP's Sudan emergency operations in 1997 is estimated at USD 43,123,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 It is generally recognized that the scale of conflict may increase in intensity during 1997 and hostilities may be extended beyond the southern states to areas bordering Ethiopia and Eritrea. The result for WFP and OLS would generally be a simultaneous increase in needy populations and limitations on access. However, given the vast geographical extent of Sudan, large-scale operations by WFP/OLS are expected to continue. WFP has in place the capacity and the planning to continually monitor the situation as events require.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kigali - The Resident Coordinator of the United Nations system in Rwanda, said today he deeply regrets the deaths of three international staff members of the NGO Medicos del Mundo and the wounding of a fourth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unconscionable that those here for the sole purpose of saving lives are targeted for attack,&quot; Mr. Omar Bakhet, the resident coordinator, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A meeting of heads of UN agencies and representatives of NGOs in Rwanda today resulted in enhanced security measures for UN and NGO personnel. Among those measures include limiting staff presence in Ruhengeri to day light hours, increased communication between the UN and NGOs, plus heightened technical and educational security precautions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the morning session, the heads of UN agencies and NGOs met with representatives of the Rwandan Ministry of Defense who promised to assist in creating a greater security presence in the area. The UN and NGOs currently are engaged in additional meetings with officials of the Government of Rwanda regarding the situation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attack in Ruhengeri Saturday night, four unidentified intruders entered the residence of members of Medicos del Mundo and shot to death a doctor, a logistician and a nurse from Spain. They were Dr. Manuel Madrazo Osuna, nurse Flores Sirera Fortuny and logistician Luis Valtuena Gallego. An American doctor, Nitin Madhav was shot in the leg, which was later amputated.  He remains in serious but stable condition in a Nairobi, Kenya hospital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - In his &quot;message to the nation&quot; on 20 January, Zairian Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo announced that he had given the order for the army to launch a war to restore the territorial integrity of Zaire. &quot;In the name of the government and in agreement with the president of the republic, I have today ordered our armed forces to conduct the war and recover regions currently under occupation and restore the authority of the state,&quot; Kengo told the nation on state television, said Reuters. He also asked, &quot;that national radio and television programmes be adapted to the occasion.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFP reported that the Zairian army had been radically restructured and new officers brought into the higher echelons in recent weeks. Four officers and ten soldiers are on trial for cowardice and another 20 officers have been imprisoned for violent crimes. All of them face the death penalty if they are found quilty. General Mahele Leiko Bokoungo, the military chief of staff, said he had been given the means to launch a &quot;total and lethal&quot; counter- offensive against the ADFL. Since last week General Mahele has been in Kisangani, widely accepted as the springboard for any military operation.  Witnesses told Reuters that there had been regular arrivals of planes in recent days and weeks carrying weapons and men. One senior dignitary in the region told Reuters that the mercenaries in Kisangani number around 300. An AFP journalist claimed to have observed increased military activity, three Russian-made MI-24 attack helicopters, three French-built helicopters, a Puma and two Gazelles, in or near Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General told Reuters that Kofi Annan strongly condemned the killing of three Spanish aid workers in Rwanda on Saturday. The Secretary-General emphasized that the violence underscored the need to find a solution to the problems of the Central African Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following several UN/NGO/government meetings in Kigali on Monday, the UN decided not to suspend their operations in the affected area. UN and NGO agencies agreed to an enhanced list of security measures, which include limiting humanitarian staff presence in Ruhengeri (96 km from Kigali) to daylight hours, increasing communication between UN and NGOs and the undertaking of efforts to heightened technical and educational security precautions. A UN communique said UN and NGO agencies are continuing to hold meetings with the Rwandan government to discuss security issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some humanitarian workers have been critical of the response, saying that not enough pressure has been placed on the government to improve overall security for humanitarian agencies and their staff. Aid officials told Reuters that they felt the decision to continue operations could lead to more expatriate deaths. Most agencies have removed all or, as in the case of Medecins Sans Frontieres and Merlin, a significant part of their staff from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zaire's government has hit back at opponents, who have called for a boycott and protests against the new larger denomination banknotes, saying any statements against their use will be treated as a threat to national security, said Reuters. The government on Friday denounced the boycott as political, saying politicians were using the issue to further their personal ambitions. Etienne Tshisekedi, the most prominent member of the opposition, and Bemba Saolona, former financial advisor to Mobutu and currently president of the Zaire business association, ANEZA, have both called for a boycott that has had popular support in Kinshasa. AZADHO, Zaire's main human rights group also urged the withdrawl of the banknotes because of their inflationary pressure and the resulting social consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michel Luya, the publisher of one of Zaire's many opposition dailies &quot;Le Palmares&quot;, was detained on Friday for allegedly publishing false stories. His lawyer told Reuters he was being detained because &quot;Le Palmares&quot; had recently ran stories about President Mobutu Sese Seko's illness and criticized the president's reorganization of the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing Zairian state radio, Reuters reported that the European Union (EU) had offered to give Zaire $35 million, 14% of the estimated $253 million, to help it organize national elections, which have been promised since 1990. &quot;We are convinced that the elections will help cool down the situation,&quot; the EU spokesperson told the radio. &quot;We encourage the government to organize these elections as quickly as possible.&quot; Most international donor countries had cut all but emergency assistance to Zaire in 1994 because of repeated setbacks in establishing the electoral process, instituting financial reforms and addressing human rights violations. Under the transitional constitution, elections must be held by July 1997. Given the dilapidated state or non- existence of most communication and transportation infrastructure throughout Zaire, many analysts consider this deadline to be unachievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Olenghankoy the head of the radical opposition's parliamentary group told Reuters that the opposition is considering sending an envoy to hold peace talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. Analysts believe that a significant victory and territorial gains are necessary before Zaire will envision peace talks with Kabila. Etienne Tshisekedi, head of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), had previously suggested the idea of negotiating with Kabila in December 1996. He allowed the issue to drop when the local press began to speculate that he was in league with Kabila.  Tshisekedi and the UDPS are from the Kasai, a region with a history of rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The International Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, heard from the most recent witness in the genocide trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of the central Rwandan town of Taba. After identifying the accused as the man who beat and tortured her, the 70-year-old witness bowed to the accused and shook him warmly by the hand. Reuters claimed spectators and participants were stunned by the move and could not agree if it was an act of forgiveness or an act of reflexive deference to her former commune leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The state-owned daily &quot;New Vision&quot; reported that two Ugandan MPs on route to a security meeting at Yumbe town, situated 20 km from both the Sudanese and Zairian borders, narrowly escaped an ambush by pro-Idi Amin rebels of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), said AFP. New Vision also reported that rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which operates in northern Uganda, killed 14 people in an attack on Gulu town, the northern Ugandan regional capital. Civilians told &quot;New Vision&quot; that an unknown number of people had been abducted in the attacks and all the residents had been threatened with death if they remain in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan authorities accused the Sudanese air force of air-dropping food supplies to the LRA in Lea Bul near the Sudan/Uganda border, said AFP. Sudan has denied the accusation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The executive director of the World Food Programme, has appealed for an urgent political solution to the refugee crisis in Eastern Zaire, saying that, &quot;in the absence of a political settlement, it is difficult to see how relief agencies like WFP can sustain such an expensive and complicated relief effort over a long period of time.&quot; WFP warned that the cost of delivering food relief to the region is now almost ten times higher than normal because rough terrain had forced WFP to rely mostly on air transport. Operational costs which are normally around $185 US per ton have soared as high as $1,600 US.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Dr Alex Boraine, vice chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, on a meeting between delegations from the TRC, the Black Editors' Forum and the Forum of Black Journalists, January 21, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a meeting lasting nearly two hours tonight, delegations from the TRC, the BEF and the FBJ discussed the concerns raised by the latter two organisations about the way in which the Commission is carrying out preparations for an inquiry into the role of the media under apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the BEF and FBJ supported strongly the holding of public hearings indicates that there is now a broad consensus from within the media on the need for such hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisations emphasised that the TRC ought to consider inviting both individuals and organisations in their own right to give evidence before the Commission. We welcome this suggestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also made a strong point, which we have to take into account, which is that there is no need for an intermediary between the media and the TRC, that the media is articulate and its various constituencies can speak for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I announced some time ago, as a result of concerns expressed by a fairly wide range of media the TRC is to review the mandate it has given to the Freedom of Expression Institute in preparations for hearings. The intention is not to penalise anyone but to fulfil our objective of being as inclusive as possible in our work. We have to rethink our approach if important stakeholders find it impossible to participate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent representative of Tanzania to the United Nations, Daudi Mwakawago, took over the mantle of office from his Costa Rican counterpart, Fernando Berrocal Soto, at a brief ceremony Tuesday in New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwakawago will preside over the group, which was established in 1964 to foster economic cooperation in the developing world, for one year. Tanzania was elected, by acclamation, to the group's chairmanship in October in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has 132 members from Africa, Asia, South and Central America, and the Caribbean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the secretary-general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has described the group as &quot;the moving spirit&quot; in the U.N. in the areas of economic and social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech at the ceremony, Annan said that the group had the responsibility of representing the interests, the hopes and the aspirations of the majority of the world's peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The group has always been a vital springboard for new development ideas and initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your work has enabled the U.N. to respond positively to the challenges of a rapidly changing international economic and social environment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEMA, Ghana (PANA) - A set of triplets were delivered Monday to a 37-year- old woman at the Pro Vita Specialist Hospital at Tema through in-vitro fertilization (IVF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This method of fertilization is the process whereby pregnancy is effected through the injection of a fertilized embryo into the womb through artificial insemination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The triplets, all boys weighing 2.4, 2.1 and 1.6 kilograms, were delivered by Caesarian section by the medical director of the hospital, Dr Joe Mainoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the media that mother and children were all doing well. However, he said that the baby with the least weight would be put under intensive care for an unspecified period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainoo said the hospital has made eight IVF deliveries since 1995. These included the triplets, and other deliveries of five girls and six boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He put the cost of this delivery method at 2.6 million cedis or the equivalent of 1,500 U.S. dollars, excluding the cost of drugs which, he said, were very expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name of the parents were not disclosed. Mainoo said the couple had, for the past 17 years, sought in vain for a child before they were put on the IVF programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainoo said the fertilization method becomes necessary when normal conception becomes impossible as a result of blockage of the fallopian tubes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A diversion will, therefore, have to be made through IVF, he said, whereby the sperms of the man and the egg of the woman are collected and fertilized in a test tube for between 40 and 72 hours before being implanted into the womb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mainoo said the pregnancy of the woman lasted 34 weeks and three days. He had expected the pregnancy to have travelled 36 weeks but had to deliver her when she started showing labor pains Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - At lease 18 officers and men of the Mozambican Defence Force have been arrested by the military police on suspicion of involvement in the theft of 83 million meticais (about 7,200 U.S. dollars) and the falsification of documents in the center and south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military spokesman told the Mozambican news agency, AIM, that the thefts were discovered by the military's internal auditing services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main problem detected was at the Maputo Military Driving School.  Several of the detained are accused of stealing 62 million meticais from the school, selling military driving licenses, falsifying the school's wage scale, and illegally selling fuel belonging to the armed forces in the period from June to December 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also theft within the military police. In the Maputo branch of the military police, 14 million meticais, intended to pay wages for October, went missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar theft occurred in the Southern Regional Military Command, where seven million meticais, the October wages for several civilian staff, were stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To explain the disappearance of the wages, those in charge of the money said they were attacked by armed thieves on the way from the bank to the military units concerned and were forced to hand the cash over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIM quoted an unnamed military spokesman as saying that, even if this were true, it did not prove the innocence of those detained, since it meant they had disobeyed the army's security norms for the transport of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military audit also detected forged signatures on the wage sheets of a brigade stationed at Chimoio, capital of the central province of Manica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All those accused have been confined to their units, while the investigations continue. The military police intend to bring the cases to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The internal audit is continuing, in order to discover if there are any further cases of theft or misuse of funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Israel has no intention of cutting its ties with South Africa and will retain friendly relations with Pretoria in the future, an official of the Israeli Embassy has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We enjoy a good relationship with South Africa, and we wish to maintain that,&quot; said Zeev Luria, the Israeli Embassy political counsellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I want to reiterate that we are opposed to a South African arms deal with Syria because it could jeopardize the fragile peace process in the Middle East,&quot; he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reacting to a statement Monday by the South African government that Pretoria would no longer maintain a pro-Israel bias in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luria added that it was important to ensure that the peace process was strengthened instead of destabilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing all we can to change the government's mind, and intensive consultations and discussions with the South African Government are continuing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This official Israeli reaction follows Sunday's statement by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki that the new South Africa had scrapped the former government's pro-Israel bias in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't follow a policy in the Middle East such as the policy that was followed by the previous regime,&quot; he said, &quot;which was to form an alliance with Israel and be hostile to the rest of the countries in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the opposition National Party has appealed to Mbeki to veto the cabinet's provisional approval of a 650-million-U.S.-dollar arms deal involving the sale of tank-sighting equipment to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement in Cape Town on Monday, National Party foreign affairs spokesman Boy Geldenhuys said: &quot;As the future president of South Africa, Mr.  Mbeki dare not allow the interests of South Africa and all its people to be sabotaged by politically-driven, ill-considered decisions by the African National Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Cabinet is scheduled to discuss the entire question of the proposed Syrian arms deal at its first meeting of the year, Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The African National Congress (ANC), the dominant party in South Africa's first post-apartheid government, has accused the United States of bullyboy tactics and hypocrisy for threatening Pretoria over its proposed 650-million-U.S. dollar arms sale to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting ANC secretary-general Cheryl Carolus told a news conference Monday that the United States was trying to force South Africa into a biased policy in the Middle East by favoring Israel over the Arab states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We take strong exception to any country acting like a bullyboy in trying to essentially usurp our own foreign policy-making capacity,&quot; she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States itself has contributed in a very biased way in the region and that in itself creates problems,&quot; she added. &quot;It's really a bit much and self-righteous to then try to speak to other people about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These remarks echoed recent statements by South African President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. They said that South Africa would not be dictated to by any country and would make its own decision regarding arms sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reaction followed last week's statement by the United States, threatening to cut off some 120-million dollars in aid if South Africa went ahead with the proposed deal to sell tank-sighting equipment to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, South Africa has pointed out that an American defence contractor is involved in an at least one of three bids for the Syrian contract by companies in at least three European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That kind of hypocrisy of the United States -- to not do anything about that aspect of it -- we find quite disturbing and out of keeping with the role which we would hope that a major power such as the United States would play,&quot; Carolus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said South Africa was concerned that its actions should not upset the precarious balance in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we think the United States should also put its hand to its own bosom and take this question quite seriously,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolus also criticized the manner in which the U.S. handled the matter. If the United States wanted clarification on the deal, she said, it could have used normal diplomatic channels rather than having &quot;some petty government official standing up and attacking the sovereignty of another country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Scientists at the Nairobi-based International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology claim to have made a major breakthrough in understanding the phenomena that cause locusts to lay eggs en masse and keep the locust swarms together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers have said that the discovery is crucial in finding scientific methods to disrupt the life-cycle of the gregarious insects which currently pose a threat to crops in various parts of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their effort complements a similar study by researchers at Oxford University in London.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its latest issue the monthly, The Zambian Farmer, the newspaper says that researchers at Oxford have identified a chemical which is sometimes found in the foam that surrounds locust eggs. It is believed the chemical could provide the key to locust control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chemical is thought to be responsible for turning young locusts into gregarious pests. It has been found that the locusts hatch as solitary insects where the chemical is absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Simpson and his colleagues at Oxford say the chemical acts on the locust embryos as they develop in the eggs and switches on the genes responsible for turning a locust from being a solitary into a gregarious insect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the young hatch as gregarious locusts which is the key to the locust's importance as a pest. If it did not make that change then it would not become a pest,&quot; Simpson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team also found that four hours of crowding by locusts was sufficient to stimulate the female species to produce the subject chemical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the knowledge gained at the institute and at Oxford, scientists say that they can develop ways to disrupt the locust's crucial life stages and find a long-term control strategy against the destructive pest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists say the locust consumes vegetation equal to its own weight of about two grams per day and that an average swarm is capable of devouring what 10 elephants are able to eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locusts generally feed on green grass and are particularly attracted to crop plants like maize, sorghum, millet and wheat. The young hoppers like maize stalks more because it is succulent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Some provisions of Nigeria's 1997 budget which Finance Minister Anthony Ani explained Monday, has continued to elicit mixed reactions from a cross-section of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some economists have hailed it as realistic, others have raised reservations on how faithfully the provisions would be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet others have adopted a-wait-and-see attitude toward the 11.2-billion- dollar estimate dubbed &quot;Budget of Growth and Development&quot; by head of state Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kayode Familoni, an economic consultant at the University of Lagos, said the budget would raise standard of living in the country, if it is properly implemented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe it is designed to be welfarist and populist in the sense that it is a budget that takes cognisance of the problems of the people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another reaction, Ismaila Funtua, publisher of the 'Democrat' newspaper, commended the government for its efforts aimed at alleviating the sufferings of the masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ismaila, who had expected the government would scrap import duties on newsprint and other publishing accessories, said the budget did not contain any incentive to the media industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A renowned Nigerian banker, Samuel Falegan, is among those who believe that the budget holds the promise of growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he warned that the decision to make the Central Bank of Nigeria independent, should be pursued with caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falegan, former managing director of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, said the apex bank could not be &quot;completely independent of government in the interest of the nation,&quot; adding that instead, the bank should aim at greater efficiency and professionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two issues in the budget that have generated much debate are the retention of the dual exchange rate regime by government and the increase of the paid- up capital of commercial and merchant banks from 50 million to 500 million naira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While bankers prefer a floating exchange rate to the current dual exchange regime of 22 naira to the dollar for government transactions and 80 naira to the greenback at the autonomous market, Ani said the government's ultimate goal to merge the two rates would have to wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some bankers feel the jump in the paid-up capital for commercial and merchant banks &quot;is on the high side&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Paul Unongo, who was minister of steel development during the second republic, said the increase would help sanitize and strengthen the banking sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous liberal terms had resulted in several bank failures, prompting government to set up the Failed Bank Tribunal. Some 200 bank chief executives have either been tried and convicted or are awaiting trial before the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organized labor has also expressed some reservation with the decision to decentralize industrial bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new arrangement, each of Nigeria's 36 states is free to fix wages and salaries for their workers, contrary to the previous arrangement in which the federal government set the ceiling for workers remuneration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor leader Sylvester Ejiofor commended the government for harmonizing the emoluments of pensioners nationwide. But he warned that decentralizing wage negotiation could pose a big challenge to the state governments and labor unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State workers had gone on strike in the past over the failure by some state governments to pay salaries or fringe benefits fixed by the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ejiofor said &quot;deregulating collective bargaining may not pose an insurmountable problem&quot; provided negotiations were conducted in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the former petroleum minister, Tam David-West, described as realistic, government's decision to base the budget on oil price of 17 dollars a barrel, public servants are disappointed that the budget said nothing about any wage increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, Nigeria's former envoy to Canada, Ayodele Kadiri, summarized the general view on the budget, when he said that &quot;implementation...is the crucial thing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A budget could be beautiful, but it may be truncated if not properly implemented,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian security authorities have arrested 22 persons in connection with explosions that have rocked Lagos, the country's economic hub, in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military spokesman said Tuesday that the 22 suspects were arrested in Lagos and its surrounding areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Col. Godwin Ugbo, the acting director of defence information, declined to disclose the identities of the suspects, or whether a former presidential aspirant and current opposition leader, Olu Falae, was among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if the 22 persons include Chief Falae and I am not going to be categorizing whether they are civilians or military, politicians or not,&quot; Ugho told journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falae was arrested in the wake of the Jan. 7 explosion, which killed at least two soldiers and injured a dozen others in an army truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other bombs exploded in Lagos in Dec. 1996, apparently targeted at the military. At least one person died, and a score of others were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November that year, an explosion killed three people, including the chief security officer of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody has claimed responsibility for the explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ugbo said, &quot;it is something positive that arrests have been made.&quot; He added that members of security forces were making progress in their investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urban terrorism, involving the use of explosives was alien to Nigeria until 1986 when Dele Giwa, the founding editor of the weekly magazine, Newswatch, died in a parcel-bomb explosion. The assailants have still not been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, there have been a dozen bomb attacks in different parts of the country, especially during the peak of political crisis in 1993 and 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The suspended secretary-general of Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), Bingu wa Mutharika, refused to be probed Wednesday by a committee constituted by the organization's Council of Ministers which he says is biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, Mutharika demanded that a committee constituted by the Comesa heads of states and government, who appointed him, investigate his alleged misuse of funds at the organizations secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been accused of using the organizations resources for personal reasons and of frequent travel to Malawi, his home country, to indulge in politics, as well as trips to Zimbabwe, home of his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He challenged his critics to check records in Malawi and verify whether or not he had registered with a political party to challenge President Muluzi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika was suspended Saturday by the Council of Ministers chaired by Chakakala Chaziya, the Malawian minister of commerce and industry. Chaziya said Mutharikas three-month suspension would facilitate investigations into the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A committee comprising of five member-states, to be headed by Zambia, was elected to probe the matter in three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in the Zambian capital, Mutharika claimed Wednesday that his suspension was a political conspiracy hatched in Malawi by unnamed people who suspected that he wanted to run for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed to be the victim of a smear campaign intended to destroy his career and high reputation built over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His suspension, he said, was the result of a carefully calculated political conspiracy. This was so, he added, because since the establishment, 15 years ago, of Comesa's precursor, the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa, the council had never discussed documents which were anonymous and whose authors were afraid to append their signatures thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The principle is that if the charges are indeed true, then those making them must be prepared to put their names on them and stand by their charges,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika said he would only appear for interrogation before a committee established by the heads of state and government, and not the one constituted by the council. He said that under the Comesa treaty the council had no powers to question him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish to observe that the council of ministers, through manipulation by Honorable Chakakala Chaziya, has already found me guilty even before the so called investigations are conducted,&quot; he said. &quot;Therefore, it is doubtful if a committee constituted by them will truly be impartial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaziya, he said &quot;very hastily&quot; accepted the anonymous documents and pushed a decision through council for the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika said he had a right to be provided with full details of the charges against him and to know the names and identities of his accusers. The council has refused to give him the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he suspects his accusers to be people from Comesa whom he had rebuked for indiscipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika also said the council had refused to allow him respond to the charges, which would have enabled council to examine both sides of the story before taking a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honorable Chaziya refused to grant me the right of response,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the withdrawal of Mozambique and Lesotho from Comesa, Mutharika said that Chaziya was incompetent to dismiss his judgement that the problem lay with external forces influencing these members to leave the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika told PANA that Comesa had major problems. The greatest of these, he said, was for the organization to resolve its relations with the 12-nation Southern African Development Community and having the commitment of member- states to run his 20-nation organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Chaziya sought to play down Mutharika's assertion that foreign forces had colluded to run down Comesa because it was one of Africa's economic success stories.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA)- The Zambia Air Force started airlifting medical supplies Wednesday to Maamba, southern Zambia, which has been cut off by floods following torrential rains since Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air force delivered mainly anti-malarial, diarrhea and cholera medicines for the 85,000 affected residents, just in case of an outbreak of epidemics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because the floods have damaged sewerage systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national radio quoted the Health Ministry as saying that the airlift was necessary because it was difficult to reach the area by road, since bridges had also been washed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical authorities at the Maamba Coal Mine were forced to evacuate patients from the local clinic Monday, after the buildings were submerged in water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian Ministry of Mines also sent a team of five senior government officials from various government ministries to assess the situation, Wednesday. The team is expected to compile a report for government action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from the town of Livingstone, the permanent secretary for the Southern Region, Sylvester Mpishi, who toured the area Wednesday, told PANA that the occasional airlift of medical supplies will be needed as long as the bridges remain unrepaired. Road engineers and electricians are already in the area to restore services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the floods had also swept some crops. The impact of this will only be felt at harvest in April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent secretary for the ministry of health, Kashiwa Bulaya, said that the cost and duration of operation could only be known after the senior government officials, sent to the area, compile their report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all parts of Zambia have been swamped by heavy rains. Meteorologists say the downpours have been mainly induced by a weather system from Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government press reported Wednesday, officials of the Ethiopian Football Confederation as saying that only seven members of the squad turned up at Rome Airport for the connection flight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest were assumed to have defected. No reasons have yet been given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is uncertain whether Ethiopia will withdraw from the remaining preliminary matches in Group C, for the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations. That event will be held in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time Ethiopian soccer players have defected in Rome while en route to Morocco. Six players left the squad in October 1992 as the national team was heading for a preliminary World Cup contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, then, opted to field a weak team which included a reserve goalkeeper and the assistant coach, believed to be in his late 40s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game was abandoned when Morocco was leading 6-0 as most of the Ethiopian players left the field &quot;faking&quot; injuries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The United States has denied that it is threatening South Africa over a proposed 650-million-U.S.-dollar arms deal with Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No-one in the U.S. Administration is threatening South Africa,&quot; said James Joseph, the U.S ambassador to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph was addressing the Johannesburg Rotary Club Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and himself had gone out of their way to demonstrate support of South Africa's sovereignty and to avoid intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have laws on our books that the U.S. Government is required to implement,&quot; Joseph Said. &quot;When a U.S. State Department spokesman was asked recently about this, he acknowledged that the government has to implement these laws. But such an acknowledgement should not be considered a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph's denial follows angry South African reaction to a reported statement, last week, by a U.S. State Department spokesman in Washington that the U.S. might cut about 120-million dollars in aid if South Africa goes ahead with the proposed Syrian arms deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington opposed the sale of arms or military technology to countries it considers are involved in international terrorism. Washington considers Syria one of these, although Syria was an ally in the U.S.-led coalition that defeated Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the state department statement, President Nelson Mandela and Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki said South Africa would not be dictated to by any power and would make its own decisions regarding arms sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting African National Congress Secretary-General, Cheryl Carolus, also accused the U.S. of bullyboy tactics and of hypocrisy for threatening the South African Government over the Syrian arms deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address Tuesday, Joseph said that while South Africa was considering what to do, he would make no public comment on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been a lot of speculation in the media on something that has not occurred,&quot; he said, &quot;and we must await the South African government's decision. Then I will be willing to talk to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph went on to say that the U.S. and South Africa had a shared value of curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton had promised Mandela in 1994 that the U.S. would provide Pretoria with 600-million in aid for its social needs. South Africa received about 120 million dollars in U.S. aid in 1996 and a similar figure was envisaged for 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of the interchange between reporters and the State Department's Nicholas Burns at the daily Department briefing on January 21 on the subject of a possible South African arms sale to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: (Inaudible) South Africa and Syria quickly, as a last question.  What is your reaction to the comments from the ANC Secretary General's comments. She described America's Middle Eastern policy as &quot;bullying and hypocritical,&quot; and says South Africa -</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: What was the first word?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Bullying and hypocritical. It said South Africa might be frog- marched into a foreign policy not of its own choosing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: That's quite a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Quite a statement. What's your reaction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I would just say, let's look at the facts here. I don't think the Palestinians or the Israelis or Jordanians or Egyptians or Tunisians or Moroccans or the Saudis or the people in the Emirates or in Kuwait would ever describe the United States in those terms. I won't even repeat the words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think if you look at reality in the Middle East, the United States is widely seen, except in Baghdad perhaps, as the indispensable intermediary and sometimes mediator. We have played a historically positive role. Just look at the events of last week in the Hebron negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, on the issue that South Africa is concerned about, the same issue we're concerned about. Our view is that all of us, internationally, have a responsibility to our own countries to the global fight against terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is inadmissible for countries, and unwise, to sell arms to Syria. That does not further the fight against global terrorism, nor will it bring stability to the Middle East. That's what we've all got to be interested in - peace and stability in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a difference of view here. We know that the South African Government has not made a decision, and we hope to continue an amicable, reasonable, and rational discussion of the issues in private. That's what friendly countries do, much in the way that we discuss our differences on Cuba with the Canadian Government. We discuss them respectfully and rationally and in a peaceful way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we would respectfully submit, it's better to have a useful, private discussion rather than this war of words which is not going to help South Africa or the United States. We won't engage in this war of words. We're not interested in doing that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Can I just ask you about -- Senator Helms has reportedly written to the President asking that the ARMSCOR situation be linked to this controversy. In the eyes of the State Department, are the two issues entirely separate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Excuse me -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The ARMSCOR situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: ARMSCOR? They're entirely separate. Entirely separate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Letter to President Clinton dated January 17, 1997, from Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, regarding a possible South Africansale to Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. President:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding South Africa's approval of a contracting permit for Syria for laser-guided tank firing control systems (valued at $650,000,000), I respectfully urge that you refrain from waiving the provisions of the Antiterrorism Act (22 U.S.C. 2378);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(As you are aware, these provisions require the President to withhold assistance to the government of any country that provides lethal military equipment to a terrorist country.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is imperative that the Administration communicate to the Government of South Africa, in no uncertain terms, that no ambiguity exists within the U.S.  Government about laser-guided tank firing control systems being &quot;lethal military equipment&quot;, and, consequently, that providing this system to Syria makes it mandatory that foreign aid to South Africa be suspended.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, I urge that your Administration cease all activities toward settlement of the ARMSCOR case unless and until the Government of South Africa provides credible assurances that the tank firing control systems will not be provided to Syria. It is unthinkable that the Administration would reward the South African arms industry with significant financial benefits resulting from resolution of the ARMSCOR case while the Government of South Africa is contemplating a major arms sale to a terrorist nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syrian acquisition of state-of-the art military hardware runs counter to longstanding U.S. national security interests in the region and represents a significant new threat to Israel. Syria continues to support and shelter more than six of the most vicious terror groups in the world; including Hamas and Hezbollah. Syria has been identified by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism every year since 1979, and it should be treated as a pariah state by all civilized nations until it ceases sponsoring terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There exists substantial American goodwill for the people of South Africa, as evidenced by the provision of $562,400,000 in foreign aid to them since Mr.  Mandela's election in 1994. It is therefore puzzling that President Mandela and many ANC members in the South African Government are willing to jeopardize South Africa's friendship with the United States for the sake of terrorists who have a history of destabilizing the Middle East and targeting American citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of intense Congressional interest in the Middle East peace process and combating terrorism worldwide, forceful action from you on this issue will receive strong support in Congress. The Government of South Africa should understand that, not only will U.S.-South African relations suffer if they arm a terrorist nation, but also a significant amount of U.S. foreign aid to South Africa will be cut off.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Mohamed Sahnoun, an Algerian diplomat who once headed UN operations in Somalia, will be named as special representative for both the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) for the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind on Tuesday admitted that a UN arms embargo on Rwanda had been circumvented from the British-ruled tax havens of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, said AFP. He also admitted that a subsequent inquiry had found delays in implementing the UN ruling in the British protectorates of Bermuda, Gibraltar and Hong Kong. Arms sanctions against Rwanda were passed by the UN on May 17 1994. Last November, documents found in a bus abandoned by Hutu extremist fleeing Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) rebels near Goma in eastern Zaire, linked a British company, Mil-Tech, with weapons shipments to Hutu militias responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide. According to an AFP report, Mil- Tech is believed to have won orders from Rwanda worth more than $5.5 million US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Following an assessment mission to northern Uganda on Saturday, UNHCR, UNICEF and International Services Volunteers' Association (AVSI) coordinated a relief operation for internally displaced people (IDP) in Kitgum district.  Hundreds of people have been killed in Kitgum since early November and some 41,500 others have been displaced over the last ten years by fighting between government forces and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The mission delivered food and non-food relief items and cash assistance of around 6.5 million Ugandan shillings to the IDPs. Further assistance could be provided to the area based on the outcome of an assessment by local authorities as well as reports to be submitted by UNICEF's health and water/sanitation experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Rwandan government issued a statement 22 January expressing its shock at the murder of three Spanish aid workers, and the wounding of an American.  According to the statement read on Radio Rwanda, the government said that the recent acts of violence in Ruhengeri were being perpetrated by members of the ex-FAR and Interahamwe militia, who recently returned with the mass of Rwandan refugees from camps in Zaire and Tanzania. The Rwandan government claimed that the aim of the attacks was to &quot;punish&quot; humanitarian organizations who are working with the Tutsi-dominated Kigali government, said AFP. The government statement said Rwanda is paying the price for the government's leniency in forgoing screening to permit the quick and smooth resettlement of the returnees. The government said that it is now putting in place concrete security measures to ensure full security for local people as well as expatriates operating in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Rwanda also announced that a further 24 people had been killed on 21 January by unknown assailants in Nyamugali commune, Ruhengeri prefecture.  Most of the dead were reported to be members of the civilian security patrols.  They said it was unclear if suspects in the deaths had been apprehended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Over the weekend, AFP reported that some 1,500 Burundian Hutu refugees in a camp near Gikongoro, southwest Rwanda, could soon be sent back to Burundi.  As most of the refugees have no intention of returning to Burundi voluntarily, many sources fear that authorities will have to resort to forced repatriation.Rwandan authorities had announced on 15 January that the refugees would be repatriated via the northern border post of Kanyaru-Haut, but there has been no movement to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Amnesty International, in a statement carried by AFP, said that hundreds of refugees returning to Burundi from Tanzania and Zaire in recent weeks have been massacred. In the latest reported massacre earlier this month, Burundi troops killed 126 Hutu returnees expelled from Tanzania, prompting a UNHCR appeal to Tanzania to halt the deportations, said Reuters. Amnesty International is sending a high-level delegation, led by former Canadian foreign minister Flora MacDonald, to Dar es Salaam from January 22 to 27 to meet with Tanzanian officials. The delegation will urge the Tanzanian government to stop the forced repatriation of Burundian refugees. &quot;This is a wider issue than refugees, it is the whole question of continued conflict and harassment in Burundi and people being forced back into that situation from refugee camps,&quot; MacDonald told AFP in London. The broader goal of the delegation's visit, she said, is to return the crisis in Burundi to public awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A spokesperson for the UNHCR told Reuters that some 22,000 Burundian refugees had arrived in neighbouring Tanzania during the first half of January and their exodus seemed to be accelerating. Over half of the newly arrived refugees are Zairians, fleeing fighting between Kabila's ADFL forces and the Zairian army (FAZ). The refugees joined some 36,000 who had fled to Tanzania in December and a further 98,000 in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Burundian army told AFP that the army had launched an attack on Hutu rebels in Kibira forest, northwest Burundi, on Saturday. He claimed that scores of Hutu rebels were killed and large numbers of weapons seized. The weapons were shown on national television on Monday. According to the spokesperson, one soldier was killed and three more injured during the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A Kigali court has sentenced Leonidas Ndikumwami, a Burundian citizen, to death for &quot;leading a group of armed killers&quot; in the 1994 genocide, a legal source told AFP. He is the nineth person to be sentenced to death since the trials began on December 27. The court rejected Ndikumwami's request on 14 January for more time to prepare his case with his new lawyer. He was not present for the sentencing Monday and no explanation for his absence was given. Many Burundian Hutus, most of whom were refugees in Rwanda at the time of the genocide, reportedly took part in the massacres.  Calixte Ngendahimana, a former low-level local official, and Jovan Bavugayubisa, a former official of the ruling National Republic Movement for Democracy and Development were sentenced to death in Gisenyi court on Tuesday. An AFP report claimed that neither of the accused were represented by legal counsel at their 14 January hearing and both refused to plead guilty or not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Humanitarian sources reported that some 5,000 Zairians were fleeing westward from Amisi, following unconfirmed reports of renewed fighting between FAZ and ADFL forces. A UNHCR spokesperson told Reuters that there had been no movement from the refugee camps in the same area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A Zairian military court has sentenced 4 officers and 10 soldiers to death for cowardice. The soldiers reportedly fled Amisi on 16 January in the face of a rebel offensive in which government troops have suffered a string of defeats, the soldiers' lawyers told AFP. The soldiers are expected to appeal within the statutory 24 hours for their case to be heard before the military court in Kinshasa. The defence argued that the soldiers were originally part of the Zairian police force, and therefore not prepared for combat. &quot;It was chaos,&quot; one captain told AFP, adding that everyone fled in different directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko announced Tuesday that Ramazani Baya, Zaire's ambassador to France, had been fired and would be returning to France by the end of the week to face prosecution for the killings of two teenagers in a car crash of 23 November 1996, said AFP. The decision ends a struggle between France, one of Zaire's main political allies in its bid to recover territory from ADFL rebels, and Zaire over the lifting of the ambassador's diplomatic immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tripoli, Great SPLAJ radio reported that Zairian Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo had met with the Libyan foreign minister on 21 January in Kinshasa. The report said that emphasis in the meeting had been placed on ending foreign intervention in the continent and greater reliance on African solutions.  Libya has agreed to help Zaire in its counter-offensive against the ADFL rebels but has not specified what form that aid will take, reported Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RTM television in Morocco reported that Honore Ngdanda, a special envoy of President Mobutu, had arrived in Rabat for meetings with Moroccan officials.  Moroccan troops were used to quell separatist movements in Shaba province following independence in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters reported that Egypt also has a special envoy visiting government authorities in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement issued by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Chairperson, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, January 22, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspaper reports on the alleged marginalisation of black members of the TRC have forced me into doing something which I should not be doing, which is issuing a statement from my sick bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, all major decisions are taken by the full Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Commissioners are black. Most members of each of the three constituent committees of the TRC are black. The chairpersons of each of the Committees, as well as the Chief Executive Officer, are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, the suggestion from anonymous sources in the Commission that it is run by a clique of liberals is insulting to me and I take very strong umbrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication is that I am almost a token chairperson who is not in control. Anyone who knows me is aware that I am not a person to be manipulated by cliques. Dr Alex Boraine consults closely with me on what he is doing. He does not take decisions other than those delegated to him without discussing them with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, when we were appointing a Chief Executive Officer last year, Dr Boraine was quite insistent that a suitably qualified black person should be appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is sad that anonymous individuals are not using the existing channels laid down in the TRC to resolve grievances because it undermines the tremendously committed and conscientious work being done by staff, Committee members and Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ends statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADVISORY NOTE: Archbishop Tutu dictated this statement from his bed and asks me to advise you he will not be available for the flood of follow-up interviews he is expecting, not even from radio stations needing sound-bites.  He regrets this but asks for your understanding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - IF mealie-meal dealers increase the price of the commodity farther than the present prices they will only be attracting the wrath of government, warned agriculture minister Edith Nawakwi yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawakwi, at a press briefing in Lusaka yesterday, said there was no justification for the price increase of the staple food because there was no maize crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The price of maize has been the same for the past two months. There is no justification of the price increase of mealie-meal. It is a very clear intention by some people to cause something. And if the price is increased farther than this they will be twisting my arm. If they do so I will move in and they should not protest of interference because I will be protecting the innocent consumers,&quot; warned Nawakwi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawakwi threatened that if millers and traders continued to increase mealie- meal prices she will flood the market with cheaper mealie-meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Minister of Agriculture I have enough stocks to dampen the prices,&quot; said Nawakwi, condemning millers and traders who she accused of forming a price cartel. &quot;The rise in price is a result of the selfish behaviour of some people. I have everything at my disposal to frustrate the private sector but that is not my duty. I want to be a friend to the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister did not, however, quantify the stocks of maize in the country but pointed out that it was easy to call her Zimbabwean colleague to get maize on credit or cash terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We liberalised to create efficiency and not oligopolies. If my arm is twisted further I can land that maize from Chinoi at half the price,&quot; she warned. &quot;I should not be forced to take measures that will dampen the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering concerns expressed by the Zambia National Farmers Union on the participation of government in the purchasing of fertiliser, Nawakwi said the government will continue to identify gaps left by the private sector and satisfy people's needs accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one would take fertiliser to Libonda, Namushakende and all those far- away places but the government can reach there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mealie meal prices, particularly in Lusaka, have risen from the K8,200 price per 25kg bag to K12,500 in some cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of millers, including National Milling in Lusaka yesterday, denied they had increased the price of mealie-meal and blamed the hike on retailers.  However, some millers believe the price of maize will soon be going up and a hike in the mealie-meal price is inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawakwi also disclosed that government was releasing an undisclosed amount of money to rehabilitate the dilapidated National Resources Development College (NRDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are putting in money to rehabilitate the college. The other colleges will have to wait. I will try to rehabilitate them within the next two years,&quot; Nawakwi said. - The Post/ZNBC</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - LUENA independent member of parliament Chrispine Sibetta has accused MMD and the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) officials of having offered recent coaching jobs to their friends so that they can &quot;chew&quot; the money together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibetta, speaking in Parliament yesterday, requested FAZ to recall the Danish trainer Rould Poulsen if Zambia has to win any of the remaining World Cup qualifying games.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambians are known as the people who know sport, but what is happening to the world of football?&quot; Sibetta asked.&quot;You have brought your friends to come and coach the team so that you can chew the loot together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibetta said unless Poulsen is brought back, Zambia will lose to Congo again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could have crushed South Africa but because of mismanagements of MMD and its officials we failed.&quot; Sibetta charged. &quot;Unless Poulsen does come back you are losing to Zaire, to Congo and South Africa again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAZ have contracted the duo of Fred Mwila and Samuel &quot;Zoom&quot; Ndhlovu to replace Poulsen whose contract ended late last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - FEW players have had the ability to play in two fundamentally different positions at the highest level and done so with great success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashios Jordan Melu was one such player, first breaking into the national side as a striker and then returning a few years later to hold the fort at the back as a central defender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both positions he excelled, scoring 41 goals in 1983 to become the league's highest scorer and winning the Rothmans footballer of the year award.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His football career began in the seventies on the Copperbelt, the birth place of most of Zambia's greatest players, and in his teens he was already on the books of the Bankroft Blades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His shooting ability was soon noted and inevitability he wound up playing center forward. In the later part of the seventies, Bankroft Blades fortunes declined and not surprisingly, Melu was signed on by the Mufulira side, Wanderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wanderers Melu was a first team regular. Not renowned for his dribbling ability, it was for his goal scoring ability that earned him a place in the national team under the then coach Colonel Brightwell Banda. His first spell was rather brief as Zambia moved from one coach to another and each brought in players to suit their style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984 Samuel &quot;Zoom&quot; Ndhlovu, then Wanderers coach, took the unorthodox step of asking Melu to play in the backline for Mufulira Wanderers and it marked the start a revitalised career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in his second spell as a defender that Melu made his mark. Despite playing at the back he got his name on the scorer charts regularly, mainly because of a ferocious shot that either rocketed into the net or brought down many a defender who stood in his way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988 Zambia qualified to the Olympic games in Seoul and Melu was instrumental in Zambia's exceptional performance that took them all the way to the quarter finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against Italy, Melu and Samuel Chomba played in the central defence and held off the challenge of Italy's Carnevale and Virdis, two strikers who went on to play for Italy at senior level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melu played in the qualifying series for the 1990 World Cup in which Zambia were eliminated by Tunisia. To this day many fans feel this was the best side Zambia has ever produced and Melu was instrumental in marshalling the backline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the Southern, East and Central African Football Association (SECAFA) Cup in 1990, Melu was signed on by the Greek side, Olympiakos, one of the top sides in the Greek league. Olympiakos fielded Melu for a full season before he was sold to an Australian side in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melu's playing career came to an end soon after the 1992 Nations Cup in Senegal. In the tournament he played his part in getting Zambia to the quarter final where they lost 1-0 to the eventual winners of the competition, Cote de' Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His love for the game ensured that his knowledge was not lost and he was appointed to the coaching staff at Mufulira Wanderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he took over the reigns, Wanderers had not won a the league since 1978. In 1995 Wanderers went on to lift the league championship with relative ease. Melu had moulded a side reminiscent of the great Wanderers side of the seventies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996 Melu led wanderers to their second successive championship and firmly re-established Wanderers as the top club in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - POLYGAMY must be outlawed in all its forms because it is contributing to the spread of AIDS, Mongu Central Agenda for Zambia (AZ) member of parliament Inonge Mbikusita-Lewanika told the House yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbikusita-Lewanika said there was a need for systematic legal system which benefit all Zambians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government should outlaw polygamy, formal or informal, it is contributing to the spread of AIDS and HIV,&quot; Mbikusita-Lewanika said. &quot;We need a legal system which will benefit all Zambians, the poor, the young, the children and all the marginalised people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Siavonga MMD member of parliament Frederick Hapunda, rising on a point of order said polygamy was part of the nation's culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it is in order for the honorable member of parliament who has been advocating for culture to call for the outlawing of polygamy,&quot; Hapunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And an MMD back bencher, Roan member of parliament Vernon Mwaanga warned government not take for granted its majority presence in parliament to pass bills which have no benefit to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga said all bills will be scrutinised to ensure that they were in the interest of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should be no expectation by the government for an automatic passing of the bills just because they know they have majority support. Every bill shall be thoroughly scrutinised and ensure that they are fair, rational and in the best interest of the country,&quot; Mwaanga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbikusita-Lewanika also said people in rural areas were not happy with the current Land Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in rural areas have no money to buy the title deeds and even if they can buy them they don't have the capital to develop the land,&quot; She said.  &quot;They are now very afraid of the current system which only favour those with money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Scientists at the Nairobi-based International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology claim to have made a major breakthrough in understanding the phenomena that cause locusts to lay eggs en masse and keep the locust swarms together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers have said that the discovery is crucial in finding scientific methods to disrupt the life-cycle of the gregarious insects which currently pose a threat to crops in various parts of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their effort complements a similar study by researchers at Oxford University in London.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its latest issue the monthly, The Zambian Farmer, the newspaper says that researchers at Oxford have identified a chemical which is sometimes found in the foam that surrounds locust eggs. It is believed the chemical could provide the key to locust control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chemical is thought to be responsible for turning young locusts into gregarious pests. It has been found that the locusts hatch as solitary insects where the chemical is absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Simpson and his colleagues at Oxford say the chemical acts on the locust embryos as they develop in the eggs and switches on the genes responsible for turning a locust from being a solitary into a gregarious insect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the young hatch as gregarious locusts which is the key to the locust's importance as a pest. If it did not make that change then it would not become a pest,&quot; Simpson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team also found that four hours of crowding by locusts was sufficient to stimulate the female species to produce the subject chemical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the knowledge gained at the institute and at Oxford, scientists say that they can develop ways to disrupt the locust's crucial life stages and find a long-term control strategy against the destructive pest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists say the locust consumes vegetation equal to its own weight of about two grams per day and that an average swarm is capable of devouring what 10 elephants are able to eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locusts generally feed on green grass and are particularly attracted to crop plants like maize, sorghum, millet and wheat. The young hoppers like maize stalks more because it is succulent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Some provisions of Nigeria's 1997 budget which Finance Minister Anthony Ani explained Monday, has continued to elicit mixed reactions from a cross-section of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some economists have hailed it as realistic, others have raised reservations on how faithfully the provisions would be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet others have adopted a-wait-and-see attitude toward the 11.2-billion- dollar estimate dubbed &quot;Budget of Growth and Development&quot; by head of state Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kayode Familoni, an economic consultant at the University of Lagos, said the budget would raise standard of living in the country, if it is properly implemented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe it is designed to be welfarist and populist in the sense that it is a budget that takes cognisance of the problems of the people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another reaction, Ismaila Funtua, publisher of the 'Democrat' newspaper, commended the government for its efforts aimed at alleviating the sufferings of the masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ismaila, who had expected the government would scrap import duties on newsprint and other publishing accessories, said the budget did not contain any incentive to the media industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A renowned Nigerian banker, Samuel Falegan, is among those who believe that the budget holds the promise of growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he warned that the decision to make the Central Bank of Nigeria independent, should be pursued with caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falegan, former managing director of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, said the apex bank could not be &quot;completely independent of government in the interest of the nation,&quot; adding that instead, the bank should aim at greater efficiency and professionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two issues in the budget that have generated much debate are the retention of the dual exchange rate regime by government and the increase of the paid- up capital of commercial and merchant banks from 50 million to 500 million naira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While bankers prefer a floating exchange rate to the current dual exchange regime of 22 naira to the dollar for government transactions and 80 naira to the greenback at the autonomous market, Ani said the government's ultimate goal to merge the two rates would have to wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some bankers feel the jump in the paid-up capital for commercial and merchant banks &quot;is on the high side&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Paul Unongo, who was minister of steel development during the second republic, said the increase would help sanitize and strengthen the banking sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous liberal terms had resulted in several bank failures, prompting government to set up the Failed Bank Tribunal. Some 200 bank chief executives have either been tried and convicted or are awaiting trial before the tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organized labor has also expressed some reservation with the decision to decentralize industrial bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new arrangement, each of Nigeria's 36 states is free to fix wages and salaries for their workers, contrary to the previous arrangement in which the federal government set the ceiling for workers remuneration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor leader Sylvester Ejiofor commended the government for harmonizing the emoluments of pensioners nationwide. But he warned that decentralizing wage negotiation could pose a big challenge to the state governments and labor unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State workers had gone on strike in the past over the failure by some state governments to pay salaries or fringe benefits fixed by the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ejiofor said &quot;deregulating collective bargaining may not pose an insurmountable problem&quot; provided negotiations were conducted in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the former petroleum minister, Tam David-West, described as realistic, government's decision to base the budget on oil price of 17 dollars a barrel, public servants are disappointed that the budget said nothing about any wage increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, Nigeria's former envoy to Canada, Ayodele Kadiri, summarized the general view on the budget, when he said that &quot;implementation...is the crucial thing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A budget could be beautiful, but it may be truncated if not properly implemented,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military spokesman said Tuesday that the 22 suspects were arrested in Lagos and its surrounding areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Col. Godwin Ugbo, the acting director of defence information, declined to disclose the identities of the suspects, or whether a former presidential aspirant and current opposition leader, Olu Falae, was among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if the 22 persons include Chief Falae and I am not going to be categorizing whether they are civilians or military, politicians or not,&quot; Ugho told journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falae was arrested in the wake of the Jan. 7 explosion, which killed at least two soldiers and injured a dozen others in an army truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other bombs exploded in Lagos in Dec. 1996, apparently targeted at the military. At least one person died, and a score of others were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November that year, an explosion killed three people, including the chief security officer of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody has claimed responsibility for the explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ugbo said, &quot;it is something positive that arrests have been made.&quot; He added that members of security forces were making progress in their investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urban terrorism, involving the use of explosives was alien to Nigeria until 1986 when Dele Giwa, the founding editor of the weekly magazine, Newswatch, died in a parcel-bomb explosion. The assailants have still not been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, there have been a dozen bomb attacks in different parts of the country, especially during the peak of political crisis in 1993 and 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The suspended secretary-general of Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), Bingu wa Mutharika, refused to be probed Wednesday by a committee constituted by the organization's Council of Ministers which he says is biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, Mutharika demanded that a committee constituted by the Comesa heads of states and government, who appointed him, investigate his alleged misuse of funds at the organizations secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been accused of using the organizations resources for personal reasons and of frequent travel to Malawi, his home country, to indulge in politics, as well as trips to Zimbabwe, home of his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He challenged his critics to check records in Malawi and verify whether or not he had registered with a political party to challenge President Muluzi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika was suspended Saturday by the Council of Ministers chaired by Chakakala Chaziya, the Malawian minister of commerce and industry. Chaziya said Mutharikas three-month suspension would facilitate investigations into the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A committee comprising of five member-states, to be headed by Zambia, was elected to probe the matter in three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in the Zambian capital, Mutharika claimed Wednesday that his suspension was a political conspiracy hatched in Malawi by unnamed people who suspected that he wanted to run for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed to be the victim of a smear campaign intended to destroy his career and high reputation built over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His suspension, he said, was the result of a carefully calculated political conspiracy. This was so, he added, because since the establishment, 15 years ago, of Comesa's precursor, the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa, the council had never discussed documents which were anonymous and whose authors were afraid to append their signatures thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The principle is that if the charges are indeed true, then those making them must be prepared to put their names on them and stand by their charges,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika said he would only appear for interrogation before a committee established by the heads of state and government, and not the one constituted by the council. He said that under the Comesa treaty the council had no powers to question him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish to observe that the council of ministers, through manipulation by Honorable Chakakala Chaziya, has already found me guilty even before the so called investigations are conducted,&quot; he said. &quot;Therefore, it is doubtful if a committee constituted by them will truly be impartial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaziya, he said &quot;very hastily&quot; accepted the anonymous documents and pushed a decision through council for the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika said he had a right to be provided with full details of the charges against him and to know the names and identities of his accusers. The council has refused to give him the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he suspects his accusers to be people from Comesa whom he had rebuked for indiscipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika also said the council had refused to allow him respond to the charges, which would have enabled council to examine both sides of the story before taking a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honorable Chaziya refused to grant me the right of response,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the withdrawal of Mozambique and Lesotho from Comesa, Mutharika said that Chaziya was incompetent to dismiss his judgement that the problem lay with external forces influencing INL002 from SSS.073 (970122-18:30) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG072G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) these members to leave the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika told PANA that Comesa had major problems. The greatest of these, he said, was for the organization to resolve its relations with the 12-nation Southern African Development Community and having the commitment of member- states to run his 20-nation organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Chaziya sought to play down Mutharika's assertion that foreign forces had colluded to run down Comesa because it was one of Africa's economic success stories.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA)- The Zambia Air Force started airlifting medical supplies Wednesday to Maamba, southern Zambia, which has been cut off by floods following torrential rains since Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air force delivered mainly anti-malarial, diarrhea and cholera medicines for the 85,000 affected residents, just in case of an outbreak of epidemics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because the floods have damaged sewerage systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national radio quoted the Health Ministry as saying that the airlift was necessary because it was difficult to reach the area by road, since bridges had also been washed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical authorities at the Maamba Coal Mine were forced to evacuate patients from the local clinic Monday, after the buildings were submerged in water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian Ministry of Mines also sent a team of five senior government officials from various government ministries to assess the situation, Wednesday. The team is expected to compile a report for government action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from the town of Livingstone, the permanent secretary for the Southern Region, Sylvester Mpishi, who toured the area Wednesday, told PANA that the occasional airlift of medical supplies will be needed as long as the bridges remain unrepaired. Road engineers and electricians are already in the area to restore services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the floods had also swept some crops. The impact of this will only be felt at harvest in April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent secretary for the ministry of health, Kashiwa Bulaya, said that the cost and duration of operation could only be known after the senior government officials, sent to the area, compile their report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all parts of Zambia have been swamped by heavy rains. Meteorologists say the downpours have been mainly induced by a weather system from Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government press reported Wednesday, officials of the Ethiopian Football Confederation as saying that only seven members of the squad turned up at Rome Airport for the connection flight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest were assumed to have defected. No reasons have yet been given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is uncertain whether Ethiopia will withdraw from the remaining preliminary matches in Group C, for the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations. That event will be held in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time Ethiopian soccer players have defected in Rome while en route to Morocco. Six players left the squad in October 1992 as the national team was heading for a preliminary World Cup contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, then, opted to field a weak team which included a reserve goalkeeper and the assistant coach, believed to be in his late 40s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game was abandoned when Morocco was leading 6-0 as most of the Ethiopian players left the field &quot;faking&quot; injuries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The United States has denied that it is threatening South Africa over a proposed 650-million-U.S.-dollar arms deal with Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No-one in the U.S. Administration is threatening South Africa,&quot; said James Joseph, the U.S ambassador to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph was addressing the Johannesburg Rotary Club Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and himself had gone out of their way to demonstrate support of South Africa's sovereignty and to avoid intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have laws on our books that the U.S. Government is required to implement,&quot; Joseph Said. &quot;When a U.S. State Department spokesman was asked recently about this, he acknowledged that the government has to implement these laws. But such an acknowledgement should not be considered a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph's denial follows angry South African reaction to a reported statement, last week, by a U.S. State Department spokesman in Washington that the U.S. might cut about 120-million dollars in aid if South Africa goes ahead with the proposed Syrian arms deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington opposed the sale of arms or military technology to countries it considers are involved in international terrorism. Washington considers Syria one of these, although Syria was an ally in the U.S.-led coalition that defeated Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the state department statement, President Nelson Mandela and Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki said South Africa would not be dictated to by any power and would make its own decisions regarding arms sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting African National Congress Secretary-General, Cheryl Carolus, also accused the U.S. of bullyboy tactics and of hypocrisy for threatening the South African Government over the Syrian arms deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address Tuesday, Joseph said that while South Africa was considering what to do, he would make no public comment on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been a lot of speculation in the media on something that has not occurred,&quot; he said, &quot;and we must await the South African government's decision. Then I will be willing to talk to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph went on to say that the U.S. and South Africa had a shared value of curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton had promised Mandela in 1994 that the U.S. would provide Pretoria with 600-million in aid for its social needs. South Africa received about 120 million dollars in U.S. aid in 1996 and a similar figure was envisaged for 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopian and U.S. scientists involved in archeological work say they have found what could be man's oldest stone tools in the Afar depression of north-eastern Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists said the stone tools &quot;were probably made by ancestral humans (homo) that lived between 2.5 and 2.6 million years ago along ancient streams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Centre for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage that announced the find in a statement on Wednesday, said however, that &quot; Fossils of the makers of the tools have not yet been found.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gona area, about 300 kms north-east of Addis Ababa and 75 kms north of Aramis, where the oldest fossil &quot;hominids&quot; were recently found, is known to contain small patches of &quot;even earlier stone tools, but their age was not confirmed until March 1995,&quot; the statement said quoting a research paper on the discovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the oldest stone tools ever found,&quot; Ethiopian paleontologist and the main author of the paper, Sleshi Semaw, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J.W.K. Harris, the American co-author of the paper and chairman of the anthropology department of Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: &quot; Surprisingly, for this earlier date, the tool makers had a clear understanding of producing sharp-edged tools, an ability which probably gave them a comparative advantage in exploiting a wider range of food sources in the ancient Savana landscape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The makers of the Gona prehistoric stone tools are still unknown, and the research team made up of geologists, archaeologists, and paleontologists from Ethiopia and the United States involved in the work plan to continue the search for fossils and the painstaking task of identifying the makers of the tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, last year, a team of scientists from Ethiopia, Israel and the United States announced the discovery of the remains of early human fossils dating 2.33 million years in the Hadar area of north-eastern Ethiopia close to Aramis, where the earliest known ancestor of early man, the famous &quot;Lucy,&quot; was discovered in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An upper jaw of early Homo, the genus to which modern man belong, has been recovered with primitive tools,&quot; the scientific team sponsored by the Institute of Human Origins (IHO) of the University of California at Berkeley, said in a statement in Addis Ababa on 19 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists said these remains may hold clues to the ancestry of living humans, since they represent &quot;the oldest family dated association of stone tools with a fossil of human ancestors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - A senior United Nations official on Thursday, challenged civil societies in Africa to press their governments to implement the pledges they made toward funding adolescent reproductive health programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie Angelique Savane, the Africa division director of the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), told journalists in Addis Ababa that it was up to governments to provide the financial resources to take care of crucial health problems, including AIDS, which mainly afflict the youth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We in UNFPA shall play a catalysing role and create a conducive atmosphere for donors to come in,&quot; she said in reply to a question as to how funds will be raised to finance the numerous recommendations that are expected from the five-day African Forum On Adolescent Reproductive Health, which ends here on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savane, who is Senegalese, revealed that in its new programme cycle for 1997, the UNFPA would be implementing projects in 12 African states, which have adolescent health as a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will strengthen our family life education programme and enhance youth groups with management skills to ensure they take action in favour of their fellow youths,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savane also said the UN agency would embark on a programme to make men more receptive to issues related to family planning. Hitherto, she said, family planning and other issues have been monopolised by women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why UNFPA chose the Washington-based Centre for Population and Development Activities (CEDPA) as its executing agency for the adolescent reproductive health package instead of an Africa-based group, Savane said she and her experts failed to find an African organisation with appropriate skills.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA)- The Zambia Air Force started airlifting medical supplies Wednesday to Maamba, southern Zambia, which has been cut off by floods following torrential rains since Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air force delivered mainly anti-malarial, diarrhea and cholera medicines for the 85,000 affected residents, just in case of an outbreak of epidemics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because the floods have damaged sewerage systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national radio quoted the Health Ministry as saying that the airlift was necessary because it was difficult to reach the area by road, since bridges had also been washed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical authorities at the Maamba Coal Mine were forced to evacuate patients from the local clinic Monday, after the buildings were submerged in water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian Ministry of Mines also sent a team of five senior government officials from various government ministries to assess the situation, Wednesday. The team is expected to compile a report for government action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from the town of Livingstone, the permanent secretary for the Southern Region, Sylvester Mpishi, who toured the area Wednesday, told PANA that the occasional airlift of medical supplies will be needed as long as the bridges remain unrepaired. Road engineers and electricians are already in the area to restore services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the floods had also swept some crops. The impact of this will only be felt at harvest in April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent secretary for the ministry of health, Kashiwa Bulaya, said that the cost and duration of operation could only be known after the senior government officials, sent to the area, compile their report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all parts of Zambia have been swamped by heavy rains. Meteorologists say the downpours have been mainly induced by a weather system from Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The Communications Workers Union (CWU) of the Trade Union Congress of Ghana has criticized the sale of 30 percent of the equity shares of Ghana Telecom (GT) without considering workers interest in the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union also balked at the price at which the shares were sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, It has appealed to the government to cancel the deal and channel it through the &quot;established order&quot; to save the country and the telecommunications industry from labor unrest. The general-secretary of the workers union, identified by the Ghana News Agency as D. Odum-Ewuakye, told a news conference Wednesday, in Accra, that the 38-million-dollar deal, was struck without the Divestiture Implementation Committee and without public knowledge of the real value of Ghana Telecom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale was made to G-Com, a consortium led by Telekom Malaysia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers union said that the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications also supervised the sale without the committees knowledge.  The committee is the statutory body in charge of all matters on divestiture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odum-Ewuakye said the real value for the 30 percent GT stake was 100 million dollars and the acquisition of a licence for a second net operation in Ghana by ACG (Ghana) Telesystem Company should have earned 30 million dollars instead of the 10.12-million-dollar offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers said that Ghana Telecom remained a viable and strategic national asset, whose preservation must be the concern of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister of transport and telecommunication, Edward Salia, has described the Union's call for the sale review as &quot;uninformed and unfortunate.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the union's pronouncements Wednesday, he said the equity share sale process was conducted by a competent and well-represented body, guided by international bidding rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said three workers from Ghana Telecom, the majority group, with a representative from the committee served on the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salia said that G-COM won the bid because it was the only group which satisfied bidding requirements and demonstrated the willingness to invest in Ghana, &quot;in spite of the biased views held by foreign investors on the African environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salia said his ministry's exclusive supervision of the sale was in line with its sector reform program. This system aims at restructuring the entire telecommunication system to make it responsive to the demands of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that G-COM was a good financial administrator and had a reputation for adherence to working ethics, which were capable of making Ghana Telecom profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the viability of Ghana Telecom, Salia said the company's liability exceeded its assets by 100 million dollars. The company may have made strides lately, he said, but its rate of recovery was discouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the ministry only sold 30 percent of the shares because it wanted to avoid the transfer of a public monopoly into private monopoly, which is against the government's economic philosophy of competition and diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The remaining 70 percent would adequately cater for the employee share ownership program, which makes all workers in GT share owners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salia said GT had demonstrated that it could not cope with the current demands for communication gadgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has grown over the years by 50,000 lines, the majority of which was actualized in the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The inefficiency of GT is legendary and any attempt to keep it in its present state would create problems for the industry and the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is certainly an anachronistic instrument due for transformation; our only chance to change it is now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - President Daniel Arap Moi has ordered the Nairobi City Council to privatize, immediately, the collection of garbage in the Kenya capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi lamented that although the council collected a monthly service charge on city residents, it had failed to meet its obligations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi, who was addressing scores of Nairobi residents outside his office Wednesday, also announced that the city would soon be divided into eight boroughs to improve administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi's order on garbage collection will be welcomed by residents and visitors who have had to live with the offensive stench of heaps of garbage across this city of two million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once beautiful city dubbed &quot;The Green City In The Sun&quot; is now considered to be one of the dirtiest in the world, characterized by uncollected garbage in residential estates and even in parts of its central business district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi said that Nairobi, being an international gateway, must project a clean image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He blamed the city's unhealthy state on incompetent management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - An embarrassing visa scam, said to involve diplomats at the British High Commission in Lagos, has resulted in the recall to London of some officials, diplomatic sources said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The alleged racket is so serious that London is sending a team of investigators to Nigeria,&quot; the sources added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a spokesman of the high commission decline to comment Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am afraid I cannot comment on the issue. I will like to refer you to the Home Office in London,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope of the racket is sketchy, with British diplomats saying little on the issue, but diplomats of other nations claimed the indicted officials were alleged to have charged applicants as much as 3,000 U.S. dollars per visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A single entry visa to Britain costs less than 40 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British High Commission in Nigeria receives the highest number of visa applications, estimated at 200 a day. But only a fraction of these are successful, because of London's restrictions on Nigerians travelling to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is a former British colony and, until a few years ago Nigerians, as citizens of the British-led Commonwealth, did not require visas to travel to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But London introduced the visa regime to stem what it called the influx of illegal immigrants, who constitute a burden on the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the restrictions, hundreds of desperate visa-seeking Nigerians throng the visa office of the high commission in Lagos on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indicted immigration officials apparently took advantage of these desperate applicants in the racket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent diplomatic sources said the current scam would be particularly embarrassing for London, which often castigates African Governments and officials for corruption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - International pressure to have the regional economic sanctions against Burundi suspended or lifted is gaining momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A German parliamentary delegation, currently visiting Burundi, said the sanctions were of no benefit and that Burundians themselves should find solutions to their own problems. Speaking to the press, after meeting Pierre Buyoya, the MPs said they would urge their parliament to support peace programmes in African countries, national radio reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African President Nelson Mandela's special envoy is also in the country on a week-long visit during which he will have talks with top officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heightened concern has been expressed by the UN and NGOs over the dire fuel supply situation: a direct consequence of the regional embargo. Faced with the refusal of the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee (RSCC) to act upon new requests for fuel supplies exempted from the embargo, one UN official remarked that &quot;we're running on fumes&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN agencies have consistently warned that unless action to remedy the situation is taken soon, they may be forced to buy fuel on the black market or suspend operations. If this happens 150,000 displaced people, returnees and other vulnerable groups will not receive the basic food rations they require to survive. Additionally, 60,000 malnourished children under five will not be provided with supplementary food in health centres throughout the country and some two million hospitalised people will not receive essential drugs and other medical supplies. Hundreds of thousands of people will also be affected by the non-distribution of seeds, fertilisers, water and sanitation supplies. Essential vaccines in cold storage, needed to treat some 190,000 children, will have to be destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the Organisation of African Unity stuck to its position in favour of maintaining sanctions against Burundi. In a statement issued yesterday in Addis Ababa, following a meeting of its conflict prevention committee, the OAU claimed sanctions should continue because of a &quot;multiplication of human rights violations&quot; in Burundi. In particular it highlighted the recent killing of some 120 returnees from Tanzania by the army. The Burundi authorities have said the returnees, forced out by Tanzania after trouble in the camps, were members of the outlawed Hutu rebel movement, Palipehutu. The OAU committee also announced it was sending a fact-finding mission to Zaire and other nations in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With mounting concern over the fate of Burundian refugees in Tanzania, the state-owned Tanzanian 'Daily News' on Tuesday reported that police had discovered the bodies of 14 Burundians buried near a refugee camp in the Ngara area. Local authorities believed the refugees had been buried alive and that the killers lit a bonfire over the gravesite to camouflage it. As a result, police had increased security in the Tanzanian camps which shelter some 230,000 Burundian Hutu refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian President Mkapa told a visiting Amnesty International delegation that his country was well aware of the situation in Burundi and would not force out the refugees. He said the 126 refugees who went back to Burundi had refused to abide by Tanzania's refugee regulations and had &quot;volunteered&quot; to return. &quot;The Tanzanian government was not involved in any way in forcing these people to return to Burundi,&quot; he told the AI team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A former UN military official with extensive experience in Rwanda warned that security incidents in the northwest of the country may just be the tip of the iceberg. Noting that the Ruhengeri and Gisenyi areas have always been the heart of Hutu extremism, he pointed out that ex-FAR/Interahamwe may resort to their often-used tactic of mining roads as aid agencies pull out of the troubled regions and travel up from Kigali instead. A possible response by the RPA would be to move some of its integrated ex-FAR soldiers into those sectors, as in the past they have proved effective at convincing Hutu civilians to support the Rwandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a hard-hitting statement yesterday, Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana pledged to put the perpetrators of violence &quot;out of action&quot;. Measures had been taken to counter the spiral of violence, which he described as a &quot; provocation that calls for tough intervention and a riposte without delay&quot;. &quot; Those who have taken to the art of killing ... will find they face a resolutely determined government, ready to act and strike equally hard to discourage their intentions,&quot; he said. According to AFP, Gasana added that his government did not want aid agencies to pull out because they were doing valuable work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of refugees, thought to be emerging from the forests of eastern Zaire, have been crossing into southwest Rwanda from Bukavu. The ICRC said since January 8 nearly 2,000 people a day had been crossing the border, arriving around the town of Kamembe. UNHCR said a total of 30,000 returnees had arrived as of January 22, malnourished and generally in very poor shape.  From the Nyagatare transit centre, they were walking on to their home communes, with the most vulnerable being taken in trucks. It is probable that yet more people are crossing the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Medecins du Monde (MDM) have pulled out most of their staff in Rwanda, following the murder of three Spanish employees in Ruhengeri. Three French volunteers remain in Kigali. MDM workers throughout the world observed a minute's silence in memory of their Spanish colleagues, who appear to have been specifically targeted by gunmen dressed in khaki fatigues. Three Rwandan soldiers were also killed. The Rwandan vice-president's political adviser, Claude Dusaidi, said three ex-FAR soldiers were in custody in connection with the incident. On Sunday, a security guard was killed following an attack on the CONCERN compound in Ruhengeri. Dusaidi said the army was sealing off the area in a bid to contain the violence and flush out the perpetrators.  Following the killing of the MDM workers and speculation about a Zairean counter-offensive, some NGOs in eastern Zaire have been scaling down their operations. MSF have reduced their staff in Tingi-Tingi camp, while Action contre la Faim (ACF) has suspended its activities there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean ADFL rebels yesterday denied that number two in the alliance, Commander Andre Ngandu Kisase, had been killed. Reports earlier in the week claimed Kisase had been killed by Mai-Mai militia in an ambush near Butembo on January 8. However a rebel commander, interviewed on ADFL's Radio of the People, described the reports as &quot;absolute lies&quot;, saying Kisase had been injured and was receiving care. &quot;Very soon you will see he is back to normal,&quot; the commander said. The denial followed Monday's announcement by Zairean Premier Kengo wa Dondo that a &quot;war&quot; would be waged to regain rebel-occupied territory in eastern Zaire. The Zairean authorities appear to be launching a campaign to raise morale in the country. Army chief General Mahele Lioko has set up a command post at the airport in Kisangani and reports from the town say disciplined troops are now guarding public buildings. Military sources, quoted by AFP, said the latest element in Mahele's morale-boosting efforts was the court martial and subsequent death sentencing of 14 officers for cowardice. The soldiers have appealed, but the sources believe the sentences will be carried out to make an example of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has returned to the war front to continue the military campaign against rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army in the northern Gulu area. A report in the Kenyan &quot;Daily Nation' newspaper today said army commander Maj-Gen Mugisha Muntu was also in the area where new military strategies were being worked out. Their visit north comes amid conflicting reports of civilian massacres allegedly committed by LRA rebels early this month. According to official sources, 40 people were killed but independent assessments put the figure as high as 300, the 'Daily Nation' said. Coinciding with Museveni's departure north, came claims in the state- owned 'New Vision' on Monday that rebels were planning a major offensive against government troops. The article alleged that Sudanese fighter planes were dropping food supplies to rebel positions in the Gulu and Kitgum areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan yesterday accused Uganda of a troop build-up along the southern front of their common border. The troop reinforcements were &quot;within the framework of the acts of aggression to which Sudan is being exposed,&quot; Sudanese Information Minister Brig. Dr Tayyib Muhammad Khayr claimed, according to Sudanese radio. He added that his government had made &quot;all necessary arrangements to confront every act of aggression against the southern border&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Two of the major players in the Great Lakes conflict, President Museveni and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac, are set to discuss the deteriorating situation in the region on February 11. Museveni will stop off in Paris en route from Washington where he is to attend a UN credit summit.  According to Museveni's press secretary Hope Kivengere, economic ties were expected to take centre stage but regional security would also form part of the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mohammed Sahnoun of Algeria looks set to be named the joint UN-OAU special representative for the Great lakes region. If the post is approved by the Security Council, it is proposed he report to the secretaries-general of both the UN and the OAU in order to strengthen coordination between the two organisations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A POST Newspaper journalist was yesterday arrested and detained at Woodlands police station for effecting a &quot;citizen's arrest&quot; of a police intelligence officer who was impersonating as Chronicle newspaper reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post reporter Kunda Mwila, at a press conference of Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) secretary general Bingu Mutharika in Lusaka yesterday, challenged a security officer who had introduced himself as a Chronicle Newspaper journalist to prove his identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Constable Innocent Kanunga who arrived late for the press briefing introduced himself to COMESA secretary general Mutharika as Vincent Mugala of the Chronicle when asking for a copy of his speech.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Mwila, who was standing nearby and overheard his Chronicle connection claims asked him about the whereabouts of 'his' newspaper's offices and when he joined the paper, Kanunga fumbled saying they had several offices and him was based at the town office. He could not tell where the rest offices were located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when asked by stated owned Zambia Daily Mail reporter, Isaac Chimpampe, a former Chronicle employee to mention some of his work mates, Kanunga failed to name any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I joined the Chronicle sometime last year and my telephone number is 236368 (but actual number is 233594),&quot; Kanunga said. &quot;I am new and I don't know many people and where other offices are located.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kanunga, under interrogation by ARMCO security officers, admitted he was impersonating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was part of our professional tactics. We have a right to cover in any way which you can't know. I have been attending all the press conferences in Zambia, even in Katete,&quot; Kanunga boasted. &quot;We are sent by the state, if I am not here how do you expect the President to know what is happening?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwila and ARMCO officers confiscated his identity card, and rushed him to Woodlands police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanunga, upon arrival at the police station took revenge on Mwila and charged him with conduct likely to cause bleach of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda was locked up in cells from 11:00 hours and was only released around 14:00 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chronicle editor, Lwendo Hamusankwa, described the act by Kanunga as &quot; stupid and should be stopped at once&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamusankwa, in an interview yesterday, said police should not infiltrate the media with stupid intentions of tarnishing the image of the independent press in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Impersonating is evil, a crime to anybody who commits it, and we as an organisation will protest formally to the Inspector General of Police and home affairs minister because we feel they have no right whatever to impersonate us in their clandestine moves,&quot; Hamusankwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have reports, from within the police and state security agencies, that we are being followed,&quot; Hamusankwa disclosed. &quot;The move by police to impersonate us maybe just one of the attempts to monitor our employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Agriculture, food and fisheries minister Edith Nawakwi yesterday warned feminist NGOs to keep away from her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawakwi, seconding the motion of thanks to President Chiluba's speech, described most NGOs as &quot;people who cry after milk has been spilled&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have heard of the so called Women's Lobby Group, the so called Women for Change with their perpetual cries. But I want to tell them today, I don't expect them to invite me to any of their meetings because they are a type of people who cry after milk has been spilled,&quot; Nawakwi charged. &quot;I am a woman, I stood in 1991 and I ran in the 1996 elections but I had none of these NGOs who came to my help.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said NGOs should not plan their programmes in the Ivory Towers of the Pamodzi Hotel but should go to rural areas were people need change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Real women are in the rural areas and those are the women who need change,&quot; Nawakwi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nawakwi also said the UNIP candidates who boycotted elections will not be missed in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How could such a group like Professor Mvunga, Reverend Zulu be told not to stand. We shall not miss them and I am sure their Great Leader needed them for company at his Kalundu house,&quot; Nawakwi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mangango MMD member of parliament Shumina charged that Women for Change were misleading people in Kaoma's Kalundu area that MMD government had sold their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;NGOs are indispensable in the well-being of Zambia but they should not dictate what government should do,&quot; Shumina said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shumina said the bill to regulate NGOs was long overdue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kapiri-Mposhi member of parliament MacDonald Nkabika said the main players in the political arena need to come together and reconcile if national challenges had to be met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Speaker, it is high time we injected maturity, reasoning, understanding, humility and tolerance in our new found democracy. This tug-of-war will lead nowhere,&quot; Nkabika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabika said while he did not want the First Republican president Kenneth Kaunda back in the presidential seat, the man should be given the position of statesman and those close to him should let him know that the country wants him to play such a role.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - HIV/AIDS has become a global village problem with the same economic and social impact on the people, observed Dr Perolou Olove in Lusaka on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closing a two week HIV/AIDS medium-term plan review (1994 -1998) workshop Dr Olove, who is leader of the national review team of the HIV/AIDS medium term plan for Zambia, said AIDS has become a global.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AIDS is a more specific disease which can only be compared to poverty and its impact is felt in all aspects of human development, it is one disease which has brought us together globally&quot; Dr. Olove said, &quot;We need concerted efforts if we have to fight this disease, and we should include even the people who have come out to confess they are HIV positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And health deputy minister Professor Nkandu Luo said government is committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS because it is well aware of its socio- economic impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the fight of HIV/AIDS will be futile if we leave the matter with the health ministry alone, we need to fight together with all ministries and the community,&quot; Professor Luo said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States - Kalusha Bwalya has received his being voted the World's 14th best player with pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the greatest honours in this business is to be recognised in the world, and this is a great honour indeed,&quot; said Kalusha in Mexico City, where the news made headlines in the Mexican press, after he was voted 14th in the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year poll. &quot;We play soccer to be recognised in the world, and nobody can take this away from me. I'm very proud of this honour, just as I'm proud of the African Footballer of the Year award I won in 1988.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazilian whizkid Ronaldo won the award in a poll of 120 international soccer coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalusha finished behind only two African players, 1995 FIFA Player of the Year George Weah of A.C. Milan and Liberia, and Nigeria's Olympic gold medal winning skipper Nwankwo Kanu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The durable 33 year-old Mexico's Club America superstar and Zambian skipper was voted ahead of a galaxy of international stars, including Italian maestro Roberto Baggio, Chilean goal-poacher Ivan Zamorano, Bulgaria's Hristo Stoitchkov, Brazilian midfield ace Juninho and the French-Ghanaian Marcel Desailly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalusha had a big year in the international game in 1996, leading Zambia to third place in the African Nations Cup finals in South Africa, and finishing as the tournament's top scorer with five goals, ahead of a classy field of scorers led by Ghana's Tony Yeboah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also inspired Zambia's World Cup first round come-back from a 2-0 hole against Sudan, captaining his side to a 3-2 aggregate victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalusha's jubilation at receiving the acknowledgement of top national team coaches from around the world was, however, dampened by the news from Zambia of the passing away of his former Mufulira Wanderers and Zambia teammate Ashios Melu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia's lost one of its greatest sons,&quot; he said. &quot;Ashios was a friend, companion and great footballer. On behalf of my family I'd like to pass my condolences to the Melu family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalusha had another soccer figure to mourn, in FIFA vice-president Guillermo Canedo who died at age 76. Canedo served as chairman of Club American from 1966 to 1986, and his son is the team's current president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top 15 finishers in the 1996 FIFA World Player poll, meanwhile, were: 1.  Ronaldo (Brazil), 2. George Weah (Liberia), 3. Alan Shearer (England), 4.  Matthias Sammer (Germany), 5. Jurgen Klinsmann (Germany), 6. Nwankwo Kanu (Nigeria), 7. Paolo Maldini (Italy), 8. Davor Sukor (Croatia), 9. Gabriel Batistuta (Argentina), 10. Romario (Brazil), 11. Zvonimir Boban (Croatia), 12.  Eric Cantona (France), 13. Roberto Carlos (Brazil), 14. Kalusha (Zambia), 15.  Predrag Mijatovic (Yugoslavia).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Ethiopian and U.S. scientists involved in archeological work say they have found what could be man's oldest stone tools in the Afar depression of north-eastern Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists said the stone tools &quot;were probably made by ancestral humans (homo) that lived between 2.5 and 2.6 million years ago along ancient streams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian Centre for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage that announced the find in a statement on Wednesday, said however, that &quot; Fossils of the makers of the tools have not yet been found.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gona area, about 300 kms north-east of Addis Ababa and 75 kms north of Aramis, where the oldest fossil &quot;hominids&quot; were recently found, is known to contain small patches of &quot;even earlier stone tools, but their age was not confirmed until March 1995,&quot; the statement said quoting a research paper on the discovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the oldest stone tools ever found,&quot; Ethiopian paleontologist and the main author of the paper, Sleshi Semaw, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J.W.K. Harris, the American co-author of the paper and chairman of the anthropology department of Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: &quot; Surprisingly, for this earlier date, the tool makers had a clear understanding of producing sharp-edged tools, an ability which probably gave them a comparative advantage in exploiting a wider range of food sources in the ancient Savana landscape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The makers of the Gona prehistoric stone tools are still unknown, and the research team made up of geologists, archaeologists, and paleontologists from Ethiopia and the United States involved in the work plan to continue the search for fossils and the painstaking task of identifying the makers of the tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, last year, a team of scientists from Ethiopia, Israel and the United States announced the discovery of the remains of early human fossils dating 2.33 million years in the Hadar area of north-eastern Ethiopia close to Aramis, where the earliest known ancestor of early man, the famous &quot;Lucy,&quot; was discovered in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An upper jaw of early Homo, the genus to which modern man belong, has been recovered with primitive tools,&quot; the scientific team sponsored by the Institute of Human Origins (IHO) of the University of California at Berkeley, said in a statement in Addis Ababa on 19 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scientists said these remains may hold clues to the ancestry of living humans, since they represent &quot;the oldest family dated association of stone tools with a fossil of human ancestors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - A senior United Nations official on Thursday, challenged civil societies in Africa to press their governments to implement the pledges they made toward funding adolescent reproductive health programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie Angelique Savane, the Africa division director of the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), told journalists in Addis Ababa that it was up to governments to provide the financial resources to take care of crucial health problems, including AIDS, which mainly afflict the youth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We in UNFPA shall play a catalysing role and create a conducive atmosphere for donors to come in,&quot; she said in reply to a question as to how funds will be raised to finance the numerous recommendations that are expected from the five-day African Forum On Adolescent Reproductive Health, which ends here on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savane, who is Senegalese, revealed that in its new programme cycle for 1997, the UNFPA would be implementing projects in 12 African states, which have adolescent health as a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will strengthen our family life education programme and enhance youth groups with management skills to ensure they take action in favour of their fellow youths,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savane also said the UN agency would embark on a programme to make men more receptive to issues related to family planning. Hitherto, she said, family planning and other issues have been monopolised by women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why UNFPA chose the Washington-based Centre for Population and Development Activities (CEDPA) as its executing agency for the adolescent reproductive health package instead of an Africa-based group, Savane said she and her experts failed to find an African organisation with appropriate skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEDPA president, Peggy Curlin, who co-addressed the news conference, suggested that a community-based approach could be employed to solve problems of funding adolescent reproductive health programmes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA)- The Zambia Air Force started airlifting medical supplies Wednesday to Maamba, southern Zambia, which has been cut off by floods following torrential rains since Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air force delivered mainly anti-malarial, diarrhea and cholera medicines for the 85,000 affected residents, just in case of an outbreak of epidemics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because the floods have damaged sewerage systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national radio quoted the Health Ministry as saying that the airlift was necessary because it was difficult to reach the area by road, since bridges had also been washed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical authorities at the Maamba Coal Mine were forced to evacuate patients from the local clinic Monday, after the buildings were submerged in water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian Ministry of Mines also sent a team of five senior government officials from various government ministries to assess the situation, Wednesday. The team is expected to compile a report for government action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from the town of Livingstone, the permanent secretary for the Southern Region, Sylvester Mpishi, who toured the area Wednesday, told PANA that the occasional airlift of medical supplies will be needed as long as the bridges remain unrepaired. Road engineers and electricians are already in the area to restore services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the floods had also swept some crops. The impact of this will only be felt at harvest in April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent secretary for the ministry of health, Kashiwa Bulaya, said that the cost and duration of operation could only be known after the senior government officials, sent to the area, compile their report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all parts of Zambia have been swamped by heavy rains. Meteorologists say the downpours have been mainly induced by a weather system from Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The Communications Workers Union (CWU) of the Trade Union Congress of Ghana has criticized the sale of 30 percent of the equity shares of Ghana Telecom (GT) without considering workers interest in the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union also balked at the price at which the shares were sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, It has appealed to the government to cancel the deal and channel it through the &quot;established order&quot; to save the country and the telecommunications industry from labor unrest. The general-secretary of the workers union, identified by the Ghana News Agency as D. Odum-Ewuakye, told a news conference Wednesday, in Accra, that the 38-million-dollar deal, was struck without the Divestiture Implementation Committee and without public knowledge of the real value of Ghana Telecom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale was made to G-Com, a consortium led by Telekom Malaysia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers union said that the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications also supervised the sale without the committees knowledge.  The committee is the statutory body in charge of all matters on divestiture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odum-Ewuakye said the real value for the 30 percent GT stake was 100 million dollars and the acquisition of a licence for a second net operation in Ghana by ACG (Ghana) Telesystem Company should have earned 30 million dollars instead of the 10.12-million-dollar offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers said that Ghana Telecom remained a viable and strategic national asset, whose preservation must be the concern of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister of transport and telecommunication, Edward Salia, has described the Union's call for the sale review as &quot;uninformed and unfortunate.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the union's pronouncements Wednesday, he said the equity share sale process was conducted by a competent and well-represented body, guided by international bidding rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said three workers from Ghana Telecom, the majority group, with a representative from the committee served on the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salia said that G-COM won the bid because it was the only group which satisfied bidding requirements and demonstrated the willingness to invest in Ghana, &quot;in spite of the biased views held by foreign investors on the African environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salia said his ministry's exclusive supervision of the sale was in line with its sector reform program. This system aims at restructuring the entire telecommunication system to make it responsive to the demands of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that G-COM was a good financial administrator and had a reputation for adherence to working ethics, which were capable of making Ghana Telecom profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the viability of Ghana Telecom, Salia said the company's liability exceeded its assets by 100 million dollars. The company may have made strides lately, he said, but its rate of recovery was discouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the ministry only sold 30 percent of the shares because it wanted to avoid the transfer of a public monopoly into private monopoly, which is against the government's economic philosophy of competition and diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The remaining 70 percent would adequately cater for the employee share ownership program, which makes all workers in GT share owners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salia said GT had demonstrated that it could not cope with the current demands for communication gadgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has grown over the years by 50,000 lines, the majority of which was actualized in the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The inefficiency of GT is legendary and any attempt to keep it in its present state would create problems for the industry and the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is certainly an anachronistic instrument due for transformation; our only chance to change it is now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi lamented that although the council collected a monthly service charge on city residents, it had failed to meet its obligations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi, who was addressing scores of Nairobi residents outside his office Wednesday, also announced that the city would soon be divided into eight boroughs to improve administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi's order on garbage collection will be welcomed by residents and visitors who have had to live with the offensive stench of heaps of garbage across this city of two million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once beautiful city dubbed &quot;The Green City In The Sun&quot; is now considered to be one of the dirtiest in the world, characterized by uncollected garbage in residential estates and even in parts of its central business district.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He blamed the city's unhealthy state on incompetent management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - An embarrassing visa scam, said to involve diplomats at the British High Commission in Lagos, has resulted in the recall to London of some officials, diplomatic sources said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The alleged racket is so serious that London is sending a team of investigators to Nigeria,&quot; the sources added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a spokesman of the high commission decline to comment Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am afraid I cannot comment on the issue. I will like to refer you to the Home Office in London,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope of the racket is sketchy, with British diplomats saying little on the issue, but diplomats of other nations claimed the indicted officials were alleged to have charged applicants as much as 3,000 U.S. dollars per visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A single entry visa to Britain costs less than 40 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British High Commission in Nigeria receives the highest number of visa applications, estimated at 200 a day. But only a fraction of these are successful, because of London's restrictions on Nigerians travelling to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is a former British colony and, until a few years ago Nigerians, as citizens of the British-led Commonwealth, did not require visas to travel to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But London introduced the visa regime to stem what it called the influx of illegal immigrants, who constitute a burden on the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the restrictions, hundreds of desperate visa-seeking Nigerians throng the visa office of the high commission in Lagos on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indicted immigration officials apparently took advantage of these desperate applicants in the racket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent diplomatic sources said the current scam would be particularly embarrassing for London, which often castigates African Governments and officials for corruption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUTARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - What started as a way of survival, during the great drought of 1992, has developed into a full-blown taste for the 8,000 baboons roaming Zimbabwe's precious timber plantations in the eastern Manicaland province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simians are stripping the bark of young wattle and pine trees at an alarming rate causing damage to the plantations in excess of five million U.S.  dollars every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baboons, whose natural diet includes a variety of plants and animals such as small mammals, birds, eggs, insects, slugs and small reptiles, were forced into chewing the bark of young commercial trees in the plantations when their diet was not readily available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the drought, they developed a taste -- and a sport -- for the bark in the plantations, leaving investors and conservationists scratching their heads as to how to deal with what has become an &quot;expensive nuisance.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grotesque-faced but highly intelligent simians target trees between eight years and 10 years old, strip the bark off the branches or, in some cases, strip off the whole tree of its bark and leave it to die, worthless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes a tree 25 years to mature and get maximum commercial value. Now, the three major timber companies which own 80 percent of the country's 110, 700 hectares of commercial plantations are spending millions of dollars trying to replace damaged trees by replanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates are that in most plantations the baboons have destroyed up to 3 percent of the trees to a level beyond commercial utilization. One company has lost at least 600 hectares of trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baboons are a menace, especially when two troops meet and engage in a contest of stripping the bark off the trees, causing extensive damage in their new-found sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timber industry, whose major stakeholders in the province and the country as a whole are the Wattle Company, Border Timbers and the state-owned Forestry Commission, has been hit hard by the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baboons have, for a long time, been notorious for being a problem animal in the rural areas where they steal poultry, raid crops or snatch groceries from children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people say that baboons have taken to this kind of behavior because man has been collecting wild fruits for sale in towns, leaving the primates with insufficient food. However, others contend that there is enough wild fruit, only that the animals have developed bad habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the timber companies, the problem is growing along with the baboon population. Females give birth to one young at a time after a gestation period of seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timber industry says it has reached a point where it has to deal with the animals to avoid further losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry, which in 1996 produced at least 120 million dollars worth of timber goods, has suggested birth control measures to stabilize the baboon population. Other strategies such as culling or hounding them out of the plantations have also been proffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the idea of killing this human-like animal has met with resistance from traditional leaders and environmentalists. Traditional leaders say that African customs forbid the wholesale killing of baboons, because doing so could cast a disastrous spell, such as perennial droughts, on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists say that the culling of the animals could disturb the ecological balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those bearing the brunt of the problem think otherwise. So, the battle lines are drawn between humans even before the fight is taken to the baboons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is currently losing millions due to the big baboon population that we have in the forests and we have no choice but to look at ways of how we can prevent them from destroying the trees,&quot; says Edward Mutsvairo, the Forestry Commission acting general manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wattle company's operations manager, Nigel Payne, says: &quot;The baboons seem to have quite a taste in pine bark and they have become a pest causing a lot of damage and losses to the industry as they have moved from their traditional food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the rapid growth in the baboon population could also be attributed to the lack of a natural predator, such as the leopard, in the forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paynes says contraception would fail in the short-term, as an immediate solution was to arrest the losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea of contraception sounds good on paper but practically it would be something else so we need to reduce the population first and then think of long term strategies latter,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive officer of the Timber Producers Federation, Bill Johnstone, thinks the baboons have just developed a hedonist habit, like smoking, of destroying the trees not because they want food but because they just love the fun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem has been in existence before with only minor cases being recorded,&quot; he says. &quot;But today, the problem has reached extremely serious proportions and if not controlled will endanger the future of the timber industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various ways, such as trappings, have been explored, he says, but the baboons learn quickly and know how to avoid the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sharp increase in the baboon population has also been attributed to the lack of proper control by the Problem Animal Control Section, a unit within the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management, which used to control the animals by using a very poisonous chemical known as Teladrex to kill them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use of the chemical was then banned worldwide in the 1980's resulting in the rapid population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnstone thinks the baboon problem can only be dealt with after a short- term method has been introduced first. So, the industry is trying to get help from countries Kenya, and Sweden which have experienced the same problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sweden, the clever animals were conquered by spraying of wolves' urine in timber plantations to scare them away as they do not stay anywhere near danger signals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the industry's survival we have to reduce the baboons immediately then we can start talking about long-term solutions which would have to be environmental friendly,&quot; Johnstone says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - African newspapers commented at length on the bombings in Algeria, Zaire's military counteroffensive against anti- government forces, student demonstrations in Cote d'Ivoire, the suspension of Bingu Wa Mutharika, the secretary-general of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the state of the continent's universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan, Algeria has been hit by bombings not experienced since the end of its war of independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronted with this, the country's papers said, government has remained incredibly mute. The papers asked many unanswered questions, which seemed to highlight their frustration at official silence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Watan wondered why it had been so easy for the bombers to set off their devices in this &quot;very well guarded&quot; capital of three million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why such ease of action?&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Khabar could not fathom what the bombers wanted to prove by destroying everything in sight, while Liberte wondered where the bombs had come from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to unconfirmed reports,&quot; it said, &quot;between three thousand and four thousand tons of explosives have been stolen from warehouses in the last two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each day,&quot; Liberte said, &quot;demolition experts defuse these bombs.&quot; But more importantly, it said, &quot;who are the masterminds behind these attacks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press also asked what game the government was playing since, Le Matin said, it had maintained an &quot;irresponsible silence&quot; throughout the entire affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Zaire military gears up for its counteroffensive in the east of the country, two of Dakar's newspapers commented on the state of the army and its preparations for battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soleil said that if Kinshasa failed to defeat the anti-government forces, then &quot;the most serious threat&quot; to Zaire would be to keep the country as one entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is the Zairean army not a reflection of a government nearing its end, as many observers think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it not a reflection of a government that finds it hard to identify with anything but power?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Laurent-Desire Kabila's resounding victory is an answer to all these questions, so too is the time it has taken the central government to retaliate,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is certainly this (government) reaction which will help us gauge the real situation Zaire,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the police shooting of university students in Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday, Sud Quotidien said that the government's decision to use force appeared more like a &quot;declaration of war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action, it said, showed that African governments &quot;still have a lot to learn&quot; about managing social conflicts, especially student demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government authority is not judged by its ability to deploy security forces at the slightest sign of social tension. Rather, it lies in its ability to make timely concessions without appearing to concede defeat,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It warned that the hardening of attitudes was dangerous because it could so easily lead to an escalation of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today only one student has died but clashes tomorrow will cause new victims and the cycle will continue,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka dailies commented on the suspension of Bingu wa Mutharika as secretary-general of COMESA, following anonymous accusations of his misuse of the organization's resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council of Ministers of the COMESA suspended him for three months and ordered him before them for a hearing. Mutharika refused, saying the ministers were not authorized for this sort of thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post said that there may have been &quot;valid reasons&quot; for Mutharika's suspension &quot;but the Council of Ministers should have been extra careful to avoid even a hint that the action was dictated by the exigencies of internal Malawian politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It failed in this respect,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Zambia Daily Mail said because Mutharika -- a Malawian -- is a public servant heading an organization funded by tax payers money of member states, &quot;he should feel duty-bound to open himself up to an inquiry, whether he believes it is a kangaroo court or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Council of Ministers, on the other hand, should give the accused...the opportunity to respond to the charges levelled against him,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's Daily Times, published in Lagos, stayed with the problems of African universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that the Association of African Universities, which met recently in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, &quot;needed to re-examine closely&quot; the role of the continent's universities &quot;with a view to making them more relevant to their societies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, it noted, had been the case elsewhere in the world, with the results of their research efforts benefitting their public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The secret of their success has to do with how well they have been able to impact upon their host communities,&quot; it said,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African universities, which were established with similar ideals, it said, had for the most part failed to live up to their billing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than provide a strong basis for development, they are becoming a perpetual liability to the governments,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This state of affairs has created many problems in its wake: the dwindling resources to universities has kept the remuneration of university teachers, as well as non academic staff very low; and led to the loss of highly skilled manpower to foreign institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has also ensured a continuous dearth of lecturers and facilities, and a consequent fall in academic standards,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the 21st century beckons, the Lusaka delegates have the onerous responsibility to come up with workable proposals to make universities in Africa more responsive to the needs of their environment,&quot; it added. &quot;A situation where many centers of excellence spend far more of their meagre resources on housing, transportation and other services is unhelpful. They should think of new ways of better managing their funds. Like their counterparts in other parts of the world, they should learn to spend more on research activities which should be the fulcrum of academia,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - African governments were urged Friday to formulate comprehensive adolescent reproductive health policies which recognize the rights of youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of their recommendations at the end of the Forum on Adolescent Reproductive Health, delegates said that these policies should be developed with the participation of the concerned age groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of the forum was on preparing African youth for the next millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum's 500 delegates also urged regional groups to &quot;support and encourage appropriate adolescent reproductive health programmes and services, particularly among sexually active adolescents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They asked the Organization of African Unity, the continent's most important political body, and other regional groups, to try and influence governments to promoting adolescent reproductive health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closing the forum, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, Nafis Sadik, said she was concerned at the persistence of harmful practices such as female circumcision, which is practiced in 26 of Africa's 53 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some one hundred and twenty million women worldwide have suffered female genital mutilation. This is a painful and unnecessary procedure,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Sadik said that some countries had started looking for alternatives to female circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, she said that parents had a key role in shaping their adolescents' reproductive health by giving them correct education and advise on sexuality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa's specialist batsmen will have to perform more consistently in the tough one-day series and against the competitive Australians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO properly quantify the true shape of a Test match, it is perhaps necessary to examine the best of the batting, how comfortable, confident and collected it manifested itself to be, and where that batting emerges from the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is especially true of the 2-0 series victory Hansie Cronje and his men managed against Sachin Tendulkar's touring Indians. Even more so when you consider the impact the bowlers had on the three Tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For India, somewhat sparsely endowed in numbers in this department, Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad laboured long, hard and largely fruitfully against the South Africans. These are seamers of great worth and a credit to the fact that they have emerged from a system - and a ground mindset on their particular patch of the sub-continent - that militates against the holders of the new ball.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, from the look of the way they have been harnessed in the six tests the two nations have just completed, and the knowledge that they will doubtless be called into similar back-breaking service against the West Indians when that series gets underway, Srinath and Prasad are in danger of being bowled into the same variety of doldrums that currently besets Anil Kumble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kumble is undoubtedly a world-class bowler, but there is a distinct feeling that he has been called on to turn his arm over far too often in the past year. It showed against South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same tack, it is also worthy of note that Allan Donald was deservedly awarded the Man of the Series accolade ahead of all the other claimants. There can be few qualms about the major portion of the bowling served up. It was consistently good and largely of an extremely high calibre.  Of the batting though, there was a far less consistent feel, and it is in this area that the examination must really be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With both sides contesting the final Test at the Wanderers given this examination, South Africa were found severely wanting; India proving themselves to be a better combination than their previous two outings in the series showed them to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it is true that the runs must come from the specialist batsmen, then national coach Bob Woolmer needs some introspective thought. The top order has proved, for the major slice of the series, to be of an uncomprehendingly brittle nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, Andrew Hudson did more than enough with the bat at Kingsmead to justify the thinking that he is indeed a class act. Brian McMillan in the lower middle order, too, showed yet again that he is the selectors' pivotal point; surely a case of slot the big man in and then fill out the side around him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is equally worthy of note that at the Wanderers it took the talents of an emerging all-rounder, picked at present more for his bowling than his ability with the bat, to show up the specialists and save the first innings from looming disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaun Pollock's face-saving 78 came at a time when South Africa had crumbled to 147 for five and were staring down the twin barrels of an Indian attack with its tail up and the threat of being forced into the indignity of a follow-on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an innings of immense value and one that could rightly be compared to the marvellously patient and professional 148 from Rahul Dravid that had been at the heart of the Indian first innings of 410.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dravid's knock - aligned to the solid contributions from the elegant Saurav Ganguly - gave the Indians the edge, even when their mainstays Tendulkar and the disdainfully wristy Mohammad Azharuddin showed a seeming disregard for the run- making talents they both own in such abundance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like South Africa, the Indians have had problems at the top of the order, struggling to find an opening pair to steer them through the fire of those first 70 runs. They have persevered though and at the Wanderers it came good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, for South Africa it unravelled and but for a superb century from Daryll Cullinan, the recalcitrance of the umpires in retaking the field after rain halted proceedings and a fortuitous weakening of the light, could have truly proved calamitous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Cullinan and a visibly relieved Donald were made the offer of calling it a day as the pewter sky lowered over Corlett Drive, it must have taken all the self-control the South African pair had not to sprint off the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cullinan's innings was a thing of rare beauty and was one that he truly owed his captain and his side. For, while it is patently obvious that he is the one most qualified to get the bulk of any South African innings, Cullinan remains a thorough enigma, leaving himself stranded in the no-man's land of the 40s or 60s so often without reaching that step up and making the landmark so tangibly within his reach, that you have almost come to expect it of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, and the inconsistency of the batters above him on the team sheet, has meant that South Africa have too often had to rely on the McMillans, the Pollocks, the Dave Richardsons and the Lance Kluseners at the foot of that same list to rescue them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are blessed with three top-order batsmen of talent in Hudson, Gary Kirsten and young Adam Bacher. But there must surely be some concern about the fact that they rarely managed to operate simultaneously. The ability of at least two of them to perform simultaneously is a matter that needs to be looked at with some urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This aspect has led to a contention - espoused most forcibly by one knowledgeable and vociferous follower of South Africa's fortunes we shall call Big George to save him from the wrath of his peers - that the South African batting has no bottle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing really could be further from the truth. They may not be a team of superstars, but this is a side that has continued to guts it out in a way that must surely even engender a smile on the stony countenance of former captain Kepler Wessels, the man who showed his country what fighting it out to the finish really means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this, the debt to Wessels mounts, but the time will surely come when heart and heroics both fail and the job at hand has to be completed according to the greater scheme of things that the glorious game demands of its players at this level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead lies a gruelling round of one-day encounters involving an Indian side bolstered by a home Test series win and the psychological victory at the Wanderers, and newly endowed with the knowledge that the South Africans are indeed human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also well not to discount Alistair Campbell's Zimbabweans who make up the third side of this cricketing triangle. Having handed the luckless Mike Atherton and his band of Poms a thrashing in the one-dayers north of the Limpopo, the Zimbabweans will be looking to carry on where they left off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And before the final rolls around in mid- February, shake off any lingering thoughts that the so-called minnows of world cricket are unworthy opponents.  Like the Indians, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. And, it must be added, have a distinct and emerging pattern to the side they select and the way they go about the business of cricket at the top level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this natural shape to the game that South Africa is seemingly fighting against at present. It is a shape that Woolmer would dearly love to emerge from his charges on the field and perhaps even on his personal laptop computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming one-day series and the Tests against Australia which follow almost immediately, the form will surely have to come back into the pre- ordained line or we shall have immeasurable problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'I don't think I've ever seen a player at 20 have so much' - Bobby Robson on Barcelona's boy wonder Ronaldo, who this week was named world player of 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RONALDO may or may not be the next Pele, Diego Maradona or Marco van Basten.  How can anyone know for certain what a newly wealthy and immensely talented 20-year-old striker with only a primary school education will make of his gifts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, all that is clear is that Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima has the potential to be the game's next &quot;great one&quot;, and in this satellite-driven, marketing-ridden age, that is enough to put the star-making machinery into overdrive. He is on the cover of this month's World Soccer magazine under the headline The Best Ever?, and in Lisbon this week he was named Fifa's 1996 world player of the year, with the previous winner George Weah finishing second and Alan Shearer third .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Ronaldo, like Pele, is a Brazilian of humble origins, and the fact that he is scoring goals at a blistering pace for Barcelona only makes the dollar and peseta signs spin faster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will we control it?&quot; Barcelona's coach Bobby Robson said. &quot;If it were left to the club, yes. But it's not up to the club entirely, is it?&quot; With that, Robson gestured toward the door separating the tranquil, private lounge from a room crowded with the scores of journalists who cover this club and, now, Ronaldo on a manic daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you control that lot out there?&quot; the former England manager continued. &quot;You'd like to, but you can't. They will write what they want. So you just hope that Ronaldo will have the intelligence and common sense to keep those feet on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those feet are what have caused the commotion. In July, Barcelona bought Ronaldo for a then record u12,2-million from PSV Eindhoven. In one season in the Brazilian first division and two in the Netherlands, he scored 108 goals in 110 matches. But despite Barcelona's huge investment and Ronaldo's already glowing international reputation the club was still unprepared for the force of his impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not just that Ronaldo, his head shaved V la Michael Jordan, continued to score an average of one goal a game: the rate that defines super stardom in the sophisticated, defensive-minded modern game. It was the way he scored his goals, weaving or bulling his way past defenders, the ball clinging to his foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronaldo has remarkable speed and skill, but what separates him from fellow centre- forwards, including Romario, the diminutive hero of Brazil's victory in the 1994 World Cup, is his strength. At 1,8m and 78kg, he looks a bit like a middleweight boxer with muscular shoulders and biceps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when opponents inevitably try to shove, hack or bump him off course, Ronaldo does not tumble melodramatically into a writhing heap in hope of hearing a referee's whistle. He bounces off and dribbles on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been in soccer a long time,&quot; said Robson. &quot;And I don't think I've ever seen a player at 20 have so much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who watched Pele star in and win a World Cup at 17 might disagree.  Brazil's coach Mario Zagalo believes Ronaldo should learn how to pass. But even Pele concedes that Ronaldo is special. &quot;The compliments he is receiving are not exaggerated,&quot; Pele said. &quot;I just think we need to make better comparisons.&quot; For Pele, Ronaldo is not a creative force in both halves of the field the way he and Maradona were. Instead, he is the consummate finisher, like Van Basten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a match at Santiago de Compostella in October, Ronaldo embarked on a mesmerising 40m run in which he beat five players. By the time he scored, even the home fans were screaming in amazement. &quot;Ronaldomania&quot; had arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know when you go to a club in Southern Europe that those leagues are on television throughout the world,&quot; Ronaldo said. &quot;The impact is much bigger.  &quot; And perhaps nowhere in the world does football matter quite as much as in Barcelona where the 115 000-seat Nou Camp stadium is as much a symbol of the city and the Catalan people as Antoni Gaudi's unfinished Sagrada Familia cathedral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronaldo is not the first foreigner to make an impact in the red and blue of Barca. Johan Cruyff played there in the Seventies, later returning as coach; Maradona spent two seasons there in the early Eighties, as did Romario in the early Nineties. Now, Ronaldo is in a team overflowing with gifted extranjeros, such as his fellow Brazilian Giovanni, the Portuguese goalkeeper Vitor Baia and Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite such an array of talent, it has not all been plain sailing for Ronaldo and company. A thigh injury put him briefly out of action in November and last month Barcelona were beaten 2-0 by arch-rivals Real Madrid in the Bernabeu. That reverse prompted Ronaldo to question Robson's tactics politely yet openly, and judging from the jeers for Barca's 3-2 home defeat by Hercules recently, he is not the only one experiencing doubts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the city simmers, Ronaldo's No 9 jersey is in every souvenir shop on Las Ramblas, the city's most famous thoroughfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the All Saints' celebration in late October, pastry makers put small portraits of him on toothpicks and stuck them into their creations. &quot;People are as crazy about soccer here as they are in Brazil, maybe even crazier,&quot; Ronaldo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Bento Riveiro, a very modest Rio suburb, Ronaldo grew up playing soccer on the streets and sleeping with a ball at night. His parents separated when he was 13, and his mother, Sonia, formerly a housewife, began selling pizzas to pay the bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spent two years with the second-division club Sao Crist&quot;vao, coached by Brazil's top scorer at the 1970 World Cup finals, Jairzinho, who is credited with discovering Ronaldo, or Rinaldinho, as he is known in Brazil. At 16, he signed his first professional contract with first division Cruizeiro in Belo Horizonte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronaldo stayed only one season, earning slightly more than $2 000 for scoring 54 goals in 54 matches before signing with PSV Eindhoven, receiving a $390,000 rise. Before leaving for Europe, the then 17- year-old became Brazil's youngest international since Pele, but he did nothing more than cheer from the bench at the 1994 World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sure, it was difficult, but I learned a lot watching,&quot; Ronaldo said. &quot;I am putting it to use now, and I plan on putting it to use in France in 1998 where Brazil will have a very young and very talented team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should be the next World Cup's main attraction and, well aware of that, Barcelona have extended his contract to 2006 and doubled his annual salary to u2,5- million. They have also more than doubled the amount of any eventual transfer fee, to a world-record u47-million, to discourage attempts by European rivals such as Milan to lure him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronaldo has a house near the beach in the Barcelona suburb of Castelldefels and a contract with Nike. He has two studs in his left ear and an expanding entourage including financial advisers and new friends. What he does not have, at least for the moment, is an attitude problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think in every club it is the same, that all the players are equal,&quot; he said. &quot;We are all playing with the same goal: winning games. I like it that way: no star, everybody the same. It was that way at PSV, and it's that way in Barcelona within the team. It's only outside that it is different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronaldo is well aware of how celebrity affected the uneducated Maradona; how the Argentine's numerous off-field problems and poor character judgments eventually sent his reputation and skills plummeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no doubt that we all can learn from what happened to Maradona,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot of bad people in soccer, and they try to take advantage of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About Maradona, they told a lot of stories, and I don't know which of these stories are true. So, I can't talk about Maradona outside the soccer field. But on the field, I saw him a lot and he is a great example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, I also live here in Barcelona. I see what's happening. I see what people are doing and sometimes it's a very difficult situation; people trying to use you. It depends on the player whether he needs protection or not. I have a strong personality. I know what the people want from me. I know with whom I can go and talk, and with whom I cannot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Ronaldo sat there, self-image and baseball cap well adjusted, a gap- toothed smirk playing on his slightly chubby face, it seemed conceivable that this time, the game just might not eat its young.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - MANY of South Africa's best middle distance athletes will not be in East London on Saturday when the trials for the world cross country championships take place. Three of South Africa's four world class women have decided the March world championships in Turin do not feature in their plans for 1997, while Zola Pieterse is available for the championships but will miss the trials to compete in a half marathon in Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Elana Meyer and Colleen de Reuck - who placed fifth at last year's world cross country championships in Stellenbosch - are concentrating their efforts on the marathon this year. Olympic 1 500m finalist Gwen Griffiths has decided to compete at the world indoor championships in Paris in March after a series of disappointing results at the world cross country championships where she has never achieved her true potential.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of these three has robbed South Africa of its only real chance of a medal at the championships where with four women to count in the team event there was a chance of a top three finish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men's top middle distance performer of recent years will also be missing from the trials after national 5 000m record-holder Shadrack Hoff underwent surgery in Holland on Tuesday. Hoff developed pains in his groin area before a meeting in Paris last year during his build-up to the Olympics.  He continued competing and had a miserable Olympics although he turned in several classy performances at home including a fast win at the national 10km championships in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was diagnosed as having a bladder problem but when he went for a check- up in Europe while competing on the World Cross Challenge circuit he found out that he had been running with a hernia since June. &quot;The doctor couldn't believe that Shadrack had turned in the kind of performances he produced last year in that condition,&quot; said Hoff's coach Kenny Bouwer of Pretoria Correctional Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe it's a blessing in disguise that it's happened now though because Shadrack will rest for a month and then start preparing for the European track season and now that we know what was wrong I feel sure that he will go much faster than his 5 000m record later in the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoff's training partner Simon Morolong will also miss the trials after returning this week from his Christmas break at home in the Free State where he didn't do much training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bouwer will still provide several of the favourites for the men's race, however. His Correctional Services squad includes Olympic 5 000m athlete John Morapedi, world junior 5 000m bronze medallist Aaron Gabonewe who has moved up to the senior ranks this year, Laban Nkete, Andries Khulu and Johannes Job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Kaotsane, who won the first trials race in 1993, is making a comeback after a serious knee injury and will be the dark horse in the strong Correctional Services pack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The favourite for the men's race, however, should be Olympic 10 000m runner Hendrick Ramaala who is expected back from Europe in time for Saturday's race.  Enjoying his first year of full-time athletics after graduating in law from Wits University last year, Ramaala has posted some impressive performances on the World Cross Challenge circuit where he has been getting used to the rather different conditions he will encounter in Turin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although form at the end of December is a poor indicator of form three months down the line, his third place in Durham just two seconds behind Kenya's phenomenal 3 000m world record-holder Daniel Komen must have boosted his morale. According to Athletics South Africa's (ASA) selection criteria two-thirds of the nine-strong men's team will be chosen based on the results of the trials with the top three at last September's South African cross country championships in Pretoria filling the remaining places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means that Tsunaki Kalamore (lst), Stephen Phofi (2nd) and Ezeal Thlobo (3rd) are guaranteed a place in the team although both Kalamore and Thlobo have opted to run the trials. ASA have also indicated that they will consider the form of any athletes competing overseas who do not run in the trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the absent Pieterse having won in Pretoria she will automatically join runner-up Paulina Phaho in the six-strong women's team. Alta Verster is expected to win in East London but she will be pushed by two of Bouwer's athletes in Louisa Leballo and Anchen Rose and Charne Rademeyer should also be a threat. In the junior women's race the prodigious Rene Kalmer is expected to be a runaway winner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Stix Morewa is leaving but it will take a lot more than that to heal the wounds in South African soccer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS South African Football Association (Safa) executive president Solomon &quot; Stix&quot; Morewa prepares to pack his bags and abandon centre stage, he leaves the sport in a sad and sick state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Pickard Commission into mismanagement in domestic football was meant to heal the wounds that have grown more septic as each year passed, it failed dismally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where once there were gaps between rival groups of officials, there are now chasms. Perhaps the shock but inevitable departure of Morewa will have a positive effect, but only an incurable optimist would bet on it. Call it Safa vs National Soccer League (NSL), call it A team vs B team, call it Kaizer Motaung vs Irvin Khoza, call it what you will. The harsh reality is that South African football remains bitterly divided.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rival officials do not talk to each other, rival organisations barely communicate. The Premier Soccer League saw plans to bring English Premiership stars like Ryan Giggs and Eric Cantona to South African dashed by Safa indifference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If truth is the first casualty in war, then ordinary football fans inevitably suffer first when officials row and South Africa owes Morewa gratitude for quitting rather than triggering a potentially bitter feud.  World controlling body Fifa reiterated this week that direct government interference in attempts to sack the R33 000-a-month Safa chief would have led to Bafana Bafana's expulsion from the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Sports Council president Mluleki George spoke this week of not resting until the sport had been fully cleaned up. It is an honourable mission, and it could take considerable time. Every nook and every cranny of every organisation at every level must be explored with a magnifying glass.  There is much that is still rotten in the state of South African football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game is awash with money thanks to a queue of generous sponsors anxious to jump on a bandwagon offering them access to a constantly growing consumer market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Breweries pumps millions of rand into the Premier League and the national senior team and First National Bank sponsors the leading knockout competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasol bankrolls the national under-23 team, United Bank carries the tab for the youth squad and Coca-Cola underwrites the junior side. These are not petty sponsorships, either, with millions of rand being ploughed into football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed sources speak of a new cup competition, with each round except the final being played on a home-and-away basis and prize money totalling R5- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small cartoon in a Johannesburg newspaper showed a satisfield Judge Benjamin Pickard walking away from a rubbish dump with one full dustbin.  Considerable waste lay behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That summarises the situation in the most popular sport in the country, a game loved by millions but constantly abused by officials more interested in promoting themselves than the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mistakes of Morewa, considered unfit to run football in a damning report released last week, were uncovered by the commission because it dug deep with shovels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it appeared only spades were used when it came to other personalties, and alleged corruption within the football media. For years there have been stories of payments for favours rendered and the same names keep cropping up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pickard Commission represented a unique opportunity to cut South African football to the bone, to rid the organisation of the individuals who put self-interest ahead of the beautiful game. When, if ever, will there be another opportunity to turn on the spotlight so strongly. There is still a stench at the rubbish dump and the game cannot prosper until it disappears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For one football fan the problems of South African football are no longer a concern because he was fatally wounded last Saturday after Orlando Pirates defeated Kaizer Chiefs at Ellis Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On yet another tragic day for soccer an unruly mob who could not gain entrance tried to force their way past police, resulting in stun grenades being fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Chiefs-Moroka Swallows fiasco at Johannesburg Stadium, the Premier Soccer League vowed there would not be a repeat. Try telling that to relatives of the slain supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, football cannot be held entirely to blame as the crowd trouble mirrors a society where law and order are under constant attack. However, other sports seem to have considerably more success when it comes to policing crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution lies in all-ticket matches when big clubs are involved with tickets going on sale several days before the match and no one without one being allowed near the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these dark days for the sport adored by millions from the Cape Flats to Thohoyandou, there is perhaps a glimmer of hope in the fact that England has largely eradicated hooliganism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once a cancer eating away the very heart of the game, it has been cured by a series of measures including the advance sale of tickets, good policing and all-seater stadiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between the countries is graphically illustrated by the deployment of security officials. In England, they face the crowd and watch for troublemakers; in South Africa they face the pitch and watch the match.  Those hired to protect South African fans are more concerned with what is happening on the field than in the stands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this relatively minor problem cannot be addressed, what price major obstacles being overcome. If there is a shaft of light within the tunnel, it is that the most important assets in the industry, the footballers, continue to excel. Derbies may be a worldwide phenomenon, but as Chiefs technical director Jeff Butler rightly said, few can match those between the Amakhosi and the Buccaneers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a passion play almost beyond compare. The magic provided by stars like Jerry Sikhosana, Dumisa Ngobe and Pollen Ndlanya offers hope of a better future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In which NATHAN ZENO gets to grips with the rarefied world of Cape Town models and their photographers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A picture ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(in which Nathan tries to understand the reality of being a fashion photographer in South Africa)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not so much that the standard of fashion photography in South Africa is bad, it's just not that simple. As photographer Jean-Marc Lederman says: &quot; In order to take a beautiful photograph, you must have beautiful clothes - the first problem - and then, well, models are also not so easy. Look at the magazine covers last month. The same girl. It's always the same girls.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thing is, he says, is that if you come up with an original angle the magazines are afraid to take the risk; the need to sell copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm Kluk, a fashion editor at Cosmopolitan, says: &quot;I don't like to take risks, I like to stick with the people I know. That way I know what I'm getting. What I'm after is very specific and I will not take risks unless I am 100% certain they'll pay off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexa Singer, model-turned-photographer, now doing editorial photo work for Cosmo - (when I try to get her number from someone in the industry who thinks I'm doing a piece on models, I am greeted with: &quot;Oooh, why'd you want to speak to her? She's so past it, she's gone all post-grunge.&quot;) - feels that, unlike most other countries where photographers get better with age, the moment SA photographers start getting solid work they slack off and lose their edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's so political,&quot; says Jean-Marc, &quot;They're not interested in your book. If you take it round they don't even look. It's all politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Granville-Matthews works mainly in advertising now, as well as producing work &quot;for himself&quot;. A couple of years back he got involved in a political wrangle (which is &quot;adolescent and not worth mentioning&quot;) and found the work dropping off. Then after another incident the work seemed to stop. &quot; It's probably the best thing that could have happened to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took a job as a doorman at the Funktion and now finds himself &quot; constantly inspired. I'm there on the street and the work is my best ever, I'm surrounded by younger people and I have to challenge myself. I really don't care if no one sees it, at least I don't have to compromise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce had a small exhibition at an even smaller gallery at the end of last year and is talking to a bigger gallery about a bigger exhibition later this year. He talks about beauty and inspiration and his language is free of the words &quot;client&quot; and &quot;advertorial&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Jean-Marc: &quot;Catalogues and commercials in this country are bullshit.  Even now the internationals are starting to use local photographers for their catalogues and they at least care a little - not too much - but a little.  Anyway it's not good enough just to work for the client, it will break your spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. ... is worth ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(in which Nathan gets to grips with the maths)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summer started late; nothing but horrible weather in Cape Town until mid- December. But there were fewer foreign fashion catalogue teams sitting cursing in hotel rooms. So few that some people began to panic. Traditionally, the catalogue season starts as early as October, but with internationals catching onto the unpredictability of the weather here, Germans with cameras have been thin on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people blame the weather, some even Pagad - but costs also rose. In the past South Africa was 45% cheaper than anywhere else. It's now down to about 20%. That, coupled with unpredictable weather in the crucial catalogue months and the fact that we are so far away, means that South Africa could start becoming less attractive as an international location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is now a body, the South African Association of Stills Photographers (SAASP) that is trying to regulate rates. By raising them they are more likely to attract international models and in turn more international teams.  It also means that local girls' rates are going up, &quot;and therein lies a danger,&quot; says Jean-Marc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A SA girl does a shoot in Germany or wherever and she gets a German rate.  She comes back here, commands the same rate, but is no longer in Germany. I am from France but I don't charge French rates. We should be careful. A big part of the reason they come here is because our top models are cheaper than anywhere else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Upton of ICE Models and chair of the SAASP feels that the price gap is closing and with our infrastructures still not up to scratch, we should be careful. There has to be some sort of incentive to make that plane ride bearable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mid season in Cape Town it is impossible to hire a minibus at short notice, and a hell of a lot of other things. While Upton is confident the industry is growing and could expand to four times its current size, he's worried the city may not be able to handle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Cape stills production down?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, not with 19 registered production companies booked for the next three months as opposed to only nine last season. &quot;Capetonians are so prone to premature ejaculation,&quot; says Granville-Matthews. &quot;The internationals aren't stupid, they've been here before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul West of Boss Models: &quot;The fashion business is very internal, it has its own workings. For some reason Cape Town is hot right now on the world itinerary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. ... a thousand words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(in which it all comes together and makes sense)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am invited in to The Model Company without question. At first I think these people - her booker, the photographer, the magazine editor - are very trusting. But while I am waiting it dawns on me that I am merely not important enough to be feared. And then she walks in the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is Tanya, Tanya Finch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, she is at first glance gorgeous. But then I realise she is gorgeous because she is about to be photographed, because she has to be, because at that moment everyone in that room is there for her and depends on her. No.  Maybe I phrased that wrong: no one is desperate - it would ruin their afternoon. If you were to take her out of context, she may even be ordinary looking, but in this industry context is very important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five people step out into the sunlight to take a photo. They are standing on a main road. Tanya is against a pink wall. Cars slow down. A Kombi slows down. In it is another &quot;team&quot; - photographer, models, assistants, two separate microcosms in one big business briefly almost collide. &quot;Looks like they're off to do some catalogue work,&quot; someone says. How do they know ? The amount of clothes in the back. Like crack military teams they all head off into the light, to produce perhaps one small moment of beauty that will perhaps make you stop for an instant and go &quot;wow&quot;. It's that small. It makes otherwise intelligent women a little crazy; it makes men in general a little crazy. It's a crazy business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is 17. She reminds me sometimes of Bjork in the Sugarcube years. Some people think she is getting fat. It's a slanderous business. The photographer calls her &quot;a true professional&quot;. He refers to her as &quot;Finch&quot;. Then sometimes she reminds me of Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Is it wrong that she left school to pursue a career ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at it this way: she could study and apply for a job and never get it.  She has taken her life into her own hands. She suffers jealousy from others similar to that gifted children do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I love most is the travel. I'm lucky to travel.&quot; Yes, she is lucky. &quot; It's this opportunity I'd be stupid not to take.&quot; She tells me she doesn't have any model friends really; that she finds them a little &quot;much&quot;. The usual model nightclubs remind her of morgues. Doesn't she mean meat markets? &quot;No, morgues.&quot; She is down-to- earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her first job was at 12. Think of it - 12. When I first ask her her age, and recoil slightly by it (thinking &quot;that's so young&quot;), she notices my slight shock, blushes: &quot;Yeah, I'm getting old. I see the new girls now. They're 11 or 12 and I remember how naive I was then.&quot; She will, she says, stop modelling eventually and get a job in the industry. She says &quot;industry&quot; as if there are no others. There is only Fashion or Fashion and Beauty - it's what she knows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After nearly an hour in make-up (during which she is perfectly still, head at perfect angle, hardly ever coming up for air), finding the right location, finding the right light, finding the right angle, a million adjustments - the photographer finally lines her up. Everyone is in place, Tanya's eyes are shut. A moment of stillness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ak-shin&quot; whispers the photographer. Yes, action, just action. There is no &quot; make love to the camera&quot; here. It's not like that. Tanya does not need to make love to the camera. Let me repeat: out of context she would be ordinary looking. And again, nearly three-quarters-of-an-hour in make- up. Tanya Finch is professional. Don't try this at home without correct professional supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rhythm of the camera as it clicks and whirrs. She knows instinctively when the shutter is open, her eyes open and close, position changes slightly.  All the clatter beforehand stops. There is awe (or maybe patience).We are watching a career girl at work, a professional. If I watch from the wrong angle her movements are alien - neck slightly outstretched, eyes opening and closing like a baby bird.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the photo is taken, a Polaroid is passed around. Everyone scrutinises it closely, looking to see if their roles in this drama have made a difference. It comes to me. &quot;Isn't it beautiful?&quot; the make-up artist asks.  I look at it. It is a photograph of Tanya Finch, of course it is.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CHRIS ROPER loves the production but resents the author of The Winter's Tale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Shakespeare peers smugly out of the homely imported foliage that flanks the Maynardville audience, his honest Englishman's brow softened by the silvery uplight strategically placed to keep him visible throughout performances of his masterworks. Big Bard is watching you, but the surveillance doesn't end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a weight of tradition that also makes its presence felt. There are people picnicking before the show, sprawling on checked rugs or leaning on wicker baskets. Champagne corks pop, glasses are filled ... Some of them have even brought along folding tables with matching chairs! These are the sort of people who sneer at yobs who eat dinner in front of the TV.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climate's delicate, the air most sweet, and the lovely Maynardville pond presents its pastoral visage to the picnickers. But if you walk around to its backside, you're confronted by piles of garbage blown there by the Cape wind. The ducks pick their way around the polystyrene markers of a brasher, American colonialism. This would all make a lovely metaphor: behind the facade of English culture lurk the intrusive invaders of New World commercialism. Unfortunately, it isn't true. There is nothing rotten with the state of Maynardville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Graham's production of The Winter's Tale makes no real effort to highlight the subversion that lurks in the heart of the play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you read the list of critics' comments included in the programme, you realise that the evening is about homage. A who's who of venerable Shakespearian old farts, the list includes the big daddies Leavis, Frye and Wilson Knight. It doesn't help that The Winter's Tale, with its artificial, tacked- on happy ending, is arguably Shakespeare's worst play. Its strident sexism and stereotyped gender roles need to be counter-acted by a heavy directorial hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hermione, Queen to Leontes, is the battered woman par excellence, so obedient to her husband that she even loves his friend, Polixenes, on command.  Megan Willson is superb in the role of Hermione, making her a luminously tragic figure. But she needs to be complemented by an equally incandescent Paulina, and although Shirley Johnston's performance is of the highest quality, the play has not been directed to emphasise that she is fighting for her friend's life. Paulina is the wildcard in the stacked deck, but here she is made to appear more fishwife than feminist. Willson and Robyn Scott (Emilia, servant to Hermione) seem to play their roles as straight tragedy, but the audience is not interested in seeing two actresses who've got their hands on rare examples of feminist Shakespearean roles, and they laugh at all the wrong moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin le Maitre as Leontes becomes more impressive as the play progresses, especially once he has got the very unlikely opening dialogue out of the way.  The opening is designed to make the audience believe they're watching a comedy, always assuming that they find comments like &quot;My wife is slippery&quot; funny (they still do). When you get to the tragic bits, the audience keeps laughing, albeit confusedly. Apparently aware of this, Shakespeare puts in a cretinous bit about lovable rustic buffoons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, it's a production full of excellent things. Effective lighting, interesting music, and performances that, taken individually, deserve the highest praise. Akin Omotoso is particularly vibrant as Florizel, and Graham Weir really nasty as Autolycus. I suppose it is wrong to wish that Mark Graham had taken the opportunity to show a finger to Big Will's obnoxious misogyny, for after all, the play's the thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Winter's Tale is on at Maynardville in Cape Town until February 22</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Bafana Khumalo on Rebecca Malope</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I always wanted to be singer, ever since I was a child,&quot; she responds to my first question as she stretches her black leather-clad legs across to the coffee table in front of us in the offices of her record company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is Rebecca Malope and this always &quot;wanting to be a singer ever since I was a child&quot; was to prove to be a pretty long and tough journey for the now- reigning queen of pop gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where does the queen hail from? She was born 28 years ago in Nelspruit and that dream to be a singer brought her to Johannesburg in the mid 1980s.  She and her sister lived in a shack in somebody's backyard. Their lot in life was not exactly rosy there because they couldn't sleep when it rained. &quot;The roof leaked so badly that we had to get up and wait until it stopped,&quot; she says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A band, Savuka - not the Johnny Clegg one - needed singers and took them both aboard. Savuka entered the 1985 Shell Road to Fame Talent Search competition. This was not exactly the stuff of legend where she immediately knocked the socks off the judges. &quot;We actually failed at the beginning,&quot; she admits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this failure was not the end of the dream because among the judges was one Sizwe Zako, who saw something in the young Rebecca. &quot;Afterwards he called her over and said that we should not feel bad and that perhaps the problem was that the song that we were singing did not suit my voice,&quot; she explains.  This pep talk was followed by the dream-making telephone number for the young singer to call so that further work on the dream could be done. It was not that simple - Malope and her sister were so down-and- out they couldn't even scrape up the money for a phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year was to elapse until another chance meeting with Zako, at the offices of another record company, where they had gone to flog their talent to another producer. &quot;We didn't recognise each other immediately, but when we realised he said he'd been looking for me for quite some time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this point on the dream started to take shape as Zako took Rebecca and her sister under his wing, arranging for them to move to better lodgings and composing a song that was to make them at the 1987 Shell Road to Fame Talent Search Competition, a gospel tune, Shine on. This was a winner and a recording contract was part of the prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first recording after this momentous event was not that much of a success. A song that was punted on the then TV2 and TV3 Ama G-Man was not one of the greatest ever recorded. She was, after all, taking on the established queens of pop - the Mercy Pakelas and the Brenda Fassies. It didn't go anywhere. &quot;The record company wanted us to record that song,&quot; she says, not particularly proud of that page in her scrapbook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a professionally cynical point of view, the change-over to gospel was probably conceived in a boardroom, not in the singer's conversion to wanting to serve god. &quot;Although I did sing disco, in every album I recorded I included at least one gospel tune, because I always wanted to serve the Lord,&quot; she says, explaining that she only recorded other genres at her record company's insistence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first gospel album she recorded was in 1990 and this was produced by the man who produced her, Zako. It was the most successful album of that year, &quot; she says, a matter-of-factly self-satisfied smile hovering on her mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She can be satisfied with her achievements because in the record industry many people agree that &quot;she is the best,&quot; as one rival record company executive describes her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her popularity stems from her ability to fuse traditional religious rhythms with pop riffs. &quot;She has the ability to put across on stage the spiritual experience she truly is having,&quot; says another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is perhaps the irony of this gospel performer's life is that hers is not a career that is limited to plying the gospel festival and prayer revival circuit. She can whip revellers at a Kool and the Gang concert to a frenzy.  Here the customary whooping it up will be replaced by people doing, quite seriously, a Zionist Christian Church shuffle, dancing around in circles and feigning possession by the holy spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanting to prove that hers is not a religious crusade but a pop one, I query this. &quot;I see nothing wrong with converting people to the word of god in places like that. There are a lot of gospel singers who would want to be where I am, but God has chosen me. For that I am grateful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is on top of the heap, planning to set up a studio at her Buccleugh home &quot;so that I can produce other young up and coming artists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the recording studio and on stage her life seems to be charmed. But outside of the those confines she has had to deal with real life issues, like her mother, then her sister dying. How did she deal with that? &quot;I prayed and the Lord helped me through it.&quot; She wasn't lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebecca Malope is the focus of the second Market concert. She sings this weekend</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Gwen Ansell on live music</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NINE pm on a crowded Friday night at the Market. Amid the stink of fresh paint and the aggressively new, burgundy plush upholstery, Hugh Masekela addresses his audience, looking avuncular and slightly bemused: &quot;Now everyone has moved to the suburbs, we're missing the dust in our lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps in an attempt to compensate, the much-hyped Market re-opening show was, in parts, as dusty as they come.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of it was so bad as to be embarrassing - although there were also musical high points that got pulses racing and feet moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lows had a lot to do with loose direction. Juvenile dancers Abo Babes are as good as you'd see in the average Hillbrow disco, but they need to be taught to use a stage space well, and not crowd each other or their fellow- performers. Ask Busby Berkeley - no expanse of cleavage can make up for clumsy hoofing. There were also rambling introductions and few signs of improvement in the rather wooden acoustic that the Market inflicts on music shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masekela these days is among the more conservative of our jazzmen. While he has written dazzling songs (like the classic Stimela) and can craft attractive solos, he too often relies on his capacity to invent a catchy riff and endlessly bash the audience over the head with it. That works in a pop context - and if there was one positive message from this mish-mash of a show, it was that you can't keep a good pop song down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mara Louw, Sibongile Khumalo and Joe Nina produced a superbly fresh re- working of Brenda's classic Weekend Special (&quot;You don't come around to see me in the week&quot; &quot;Problems with transport, baby, and the cellphone wasn't working.  &quot;) Some enterprising record company should pick this up, and video the deliciously comic stagecraft that accompanied it. Everyone had fun on Victor Ndlazilwane's Skandamayeza, and Ntyilo Ntyilo provided the cue for a moving harp solo from Kenny Mathaba, who also hit us with inventive and stylish jazz guitar. Standing unobtrusively at the back, Fana Zulu demonstrated what an accomplished bassist he has become, and took one wonderful solo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was Ray Phiri. Phiri was simply brilliant. It wasn't just the great voice, guitar and snake lips, but the intensity and commitment he put into his performance - showing respect for his audience and giving space to his band. And Whispers in the Deep deserves its classic status - both tune and lyrics have universal and transcendent human appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Nina also has universal appeal. Like most teen idols everywhere, he has a pretty face and a neat back view on to which every girl in the audience can graft her fantasies. He's also a capable crooner and - as this show regrettably never demonstrated - a genuine &quot;killer&quot; at the kwaito production desk. That omission reveals a problem with the show that goes deeper than taste. While it rightly paid tribute to the neglected innovators of the past, we got little sense of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nina was there: his top talent wasn't showcased. Moses Molelekwa was there but in this, an ideal context, his drum'n'bass experiments and his cutting- edge improvising talents were hardly referred to. The music of South African youth was allowed to speak only in its most conservative dialect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been said jazzmen can be either creators or curators. On this showing, Masekela is definitely the latter. But is the incessant reworking of past hits the face the Market -once our most developmental theatre - wants to show to the world? Even if it does fill seats?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Abo Babes: THREE small, young and shy little women troop into the lounge, throw themselves down on the couch and gaze expectantly at you, volunteering nothing. Well, that's what happens when you're 14 and 15, as Mammi Vilankulu and Khumo Mokae are ... you defer to the grown-ups.  Jeanette Mokhela, though, is 20, a sister to respected choreographer Nomsa Manaka, and unsurprisingly, the most vocal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three of them make up a group called Abo Babes, which you might think is a play on &quot;aborigines&quot;, but is apparently just township slang for, well, township babes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've released a kwaito CD called Bathi Hai Man, produced by Chicco, which has now gone gold (25 000). The video to the title track, directed by Melvin Khaoli and Life Morewane, was among the nominations for Best Music Video/Clip From Africa at the Midem Awards in Cannes this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also appeared at The Market Theatre last week in Hugh Masekela's musical get- together that married kwaito with old guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if they do the bump'n'grind on stage as made notorious by Abashante, they shriek &quot;No!&quot; in unison, and add: &quot;Our parents would kill us!&quot; Still, the pelvic routine on Bathi Hai Man is not exactly virginal, even if the casual jeans are a lot more innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were thrust into the music scene through their dance teacher Wendy Ramokgadi, who runs a school, Transcend Dancers, in Meadowlands. With two years at Moving into Dance behind him, he now orchestrates dance routines for music videos, theatres and mass displays, such as at the African Cup of Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramokgadi is also an old friend of Chicco's, so when the producer said he was looking for a new all-girl group, he took his pupils along for an audition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girls all say their parents are happy for them, although they weren't at first. Says Ramokgadi: &quot;I had to convince them that their children could finish school as well as have a singing career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khumo, 15, is in standard nine, Mammy, 14, is in standard seven and Jeanette passed matric in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't ignore their talent, and stop them from doing something they love. If you do, they are going to turn out bitter and disillusioned,&quot; adds Ramokgadi, who acts as manager/chaperone at every event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what is Bathi Hai Man about? &quot;It's talking about a guy called Bob,&quot; explains Jeanette. &quot;He's silly, a womaniser. It describes the kind of situation where he'd be with one woman and relying on her for everything, especially money. If she then loses her money, he just goes to the next woman.  So the song is saying 'Stop that, man.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are they feminists? More giggles. &quot;Not really. But this is something that happens every day and nobody does anything about it. I hope this sends a message to everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girls did not, however, write the lyrics themselves, Chicco did. &quot;But he did bring us the songs and ask us if we felt comfortable singing them. So we did have the chance for input and we said they're fine,&quot; says Jeanette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wouldn't they like to learn more about music? Play instruments? Compose? &quot; Hugh is interested in developing them,&quot; says Ramokgadi. &quot;Kwaito's in now, but in two years' time it'll be something else and they need to be more versatile.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Jeanette has just started learning piano and does already play some percussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They've also made some money by now, with all three giving half of their earnings to their mothers. Khumo and Mammy put the other half in savings and Jeanette uses it to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And are they recognised in the streets by now? &quot;Yes! It's just wonderful,&quot; they chorus, glowing with innocence and possibility. Here's hoping life is kind.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SA musicians have come together to relaunch the main stage at Johannesburg's Market Theatre. We profile who's who of the old and the new - and look at why they're making waves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria McCloy on Kwaito</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONTRARY to what he said in the press over the past two weeks, Arthur Mafokate, kwaito star and owner of the 999 music label is not quitting the music industry - but the reasons he initially gave for retiring highlight a much-hyped dispute between Kalawa Jazzmee records headed by Don Laka and Oscar &quot;The Big O&quot; Mdlongwa versus Arthur's 999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two record companies are enormous money-spinners and stand out as the premier independent producers of the hugely popular kwaito (DeGong or township house) music trend of the Nineties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Arthur said the rivalry had moved up a gear and that his life was in danger. He further claimed that his brother was beaten up outside the 999 Hillbrow office. He refused to say who was responsible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rivalry between 999's Abashante and Kalawa's Boom Shaka is a matter of public record. And the Kalawa/999 feud has been further fuelled by a song from Kalawa's Brothers of Peace that blatantly accuses Arthur of plagiarism.  Arthur calls these plagiarism charges &quot;nonsense&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While an informed source this week claimed that Kalawa is responsible for the threats to Arthur, Kalawa's Oscar (a member of Brothers of Peace) said that the people making the threats should stop. Arthur said he was returning to the business because he and his fans had managed to convince his parents - who were scared for his safety and had convinced him to retire - that his bands needed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After announcing he was about to quit, Arthur said he would fulfil all performance commitments, but did not appear at last week's Hugh Masekela concert at the Market Theatre, even though he and Abashante were billed. This week he said this was related to &quot;the ongoing problems within the industry ...  my life was in danger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However a Market insider who wished not to be named says that Arthur's publicist knew all along that Arthur would not be performing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Tladi, who organised the concert, claims Arthur simply never pitched and that Abashante left after they decided the money was not sufficient. But according to another source Arthur did not perform because he felt Masekela wanted the women of Abashante to appear as mere dancing girls - which he saw as undermining their singing and rapping abilities. The source said that &quot; they are more than pretty young backing dancers willing to have their butts pinched by old legends&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite media talk of &quot;kwaito wars&quot; to rival the East Coast/West Coast rap wars in America, Kalawa's Laka this week played down the drama, blaming the media for blowing up a healthy competition between rival companies and labelling it &quot;war&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Laka and others in the industry hinted that Arthur was also using the situation to promote himself and Kalawa's Dolly Gaehler claims that last year Abashante refused to perform with Boom Shaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several commentators have added that competition is inevitable in such a rapidly growing music market - where teenagers suddenly find themselves driving BMWs and managers like Arthur and Oscar are turning up to R200 000 per festival organised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious battles in South Africa's pop industry are nothing new: diva Brenda Fassie verbally attacked Yvonne Chaka Chaka in the Eighties (in one instance leading to deaths at a stadium concert) and then Rebecca Malope in the Nineties. Later Brenda and Senyaka were at one another's throats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In further developments this week, Laka dismissed Arthur's talk of death threats and even went on to claim that Arthur and Oscar are, in fact, friends.  Yet at the same time he said that the two have been brought together several times over the past year to make peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, Laka has instructed all Kalawa employees not to discuss details of the feud with the press. On Tuesday of this week Arthur and Oscar had yet another meeting and it was there that Arthur was again asked not to quit.  Others say that Arthur had never intended to quit and is milking the publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its most severe, the Kalawa/999 rivalry has seen repeated rumours of guns being carried and pulled and particular talk of an ongoing heated exchange involving female members of both Kalawa and 999 being involved with the same man, who works in the 999 stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One observer says that there is no animosity between the two front men - but problems that have arisen come from personal disputes of lesser members of each crew. Both Kalawa and 999 employ between 60 and 70 people each on a daily basis. He added that Arthur and Oscar were resolved to discipline members within their respective groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several industry insiders have said the fight all comes down to money and a control of the kwaito market - that and a battle of egos as to who will ultimately wear the kwaito crown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kwaito proponents are calling for an end to the feud. There is a need for unity because kwaito already has enough critics. The &quot;old school&quot; sees kwaito as talentless, mass- produced and lyrically mundane drivel, and along with this comes accusations of being too sexually explicit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not many music critics have looked beyond the fact that they don't like the music, and they haven't acknowledged that kwaito has become popular and influential in South Africa in a very short time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is room for more creativity in this genre. There are around five major players producing all the local sounds we hear in clubs and on the radio, resulting in hearing four bars of a song and knowing exactly who the producer is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New blood and fresh ideas are needed. Competition, materialism and inflated egos will only prevent young South African music producers from creating the next music culture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - MARK Hipper is concluding his teaching stint at Michaelis School of Fine Art and his sojourn in Cape Town with an exhibition of his own work and selected works of second-year painting students he taught. The arrangement of the Association of Visual Arts Gallery in Church Street conveniently allows for the exhibition to be divided into three more or less discreet areas: the annexe and main gallery containing Hipper's work, and the upstairs Art Strip for the student work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emma Bedford, in an introductory statement for the exhibition, suggests that the works in the annexe ought to be understood as providing a prefatory conceptual framework, a lens through which to view the works in the main gallery. An interesting idea, but not one that is convincingly conveyed by the works installed, which contain a hodge- podge of allusions to the interpenetration of sexuality, identity and politics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notable are two works that address vision, that depict young girls with impaired eyesight, sourced from medical books. In A Most Tender Gaze, an installation in two parts, a drawing of a squinting girl is suspended on wires before a similarly suspended fleshy landscape in which a large, vaguely ectopic phallic shape is foregrounded. The girl's gaze is both fixed on the landscape, and, because one eye turns inward, on herself. The other drawing Good Vision Should Be Maintained, is simply attached to the opposite far wall of the annexe and shows the upper half of a young girl's face, framed by awkward corrective spectacles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A work about vision is a small monochromatic painting of a boy's head.  Painted across his eyes is a band of transparent grey-white paint, possibly suggesting a blindfold or censoring strip. Suspended beneath the work, hanging from thin wires, is a small blackboard with the word &quot;Shame&quot; written on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read in relation to one another, the works suggest a questioning of the societal view of child sexuality, of how this nascent sexuality can be repressed, moulded and distorted by adult morality and guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These images, along with a drawing of a boy's bloody knees topped by short Voortrekker pants, enter one into a nightmarish world of adult sexuality, abusive, voyeuristic and fetishistic. It is with these dovetailing and yet conflicting messages that one enters the main gallery. It is finally unclear what point is being made - the lens seems blurred, the artist oscillating between rhetorical constructs and visceral involvement in a sexualised subject. And it is with a sense of uncertainty that one ventures into the central gallery space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, one is presented with a long wall filled with life-sized drawings in charcoal of children either masturbating or displaying their genitals in variously startling ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the questions being asked about The Gaze in some of the works in the annexe, it is hard to reconcile the shadowy, blurred heads of the generally prepubescent bodies in Figure Series 1-11 with Bedford's suggestion that &quot;unlike pornography, which presents the body for consumption, these works are largely about human subjects exploring their own bodies and, in the process, discovering or constituting their own sexual identity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a view of sexuality that circumvents rather than challenges the social order, and perhaps accounts for what is unusual and potentially disturbing in Hipper's work. The presence of allusions to the relations between social/ political order and sexuality in certain of the annexe gallery works seem gratuitous and tricksy, a kind of special pleading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it is these drawings that are the most successful and tightly conceived on the exhibition. However, the confluence of diverting subject matter and confident execution that lends them their resolution and intensity eludes the remainder of the works on show, which appear tacked on, a series of after- thoughts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This consists of a group of portrait drawings of the artist's students. The quality of this work is decidedly uneven, sometimes giving the impression of being rushed rather than spontaneous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is finally this lack of relatedness and uncertainty of purpose that permeates the exhibition as a whole, leaving one with the feeling that Hipper is jumping at ideas, rehashing old ones and generally groping around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this evidence of restlessness and irresolution may also herald good things for an artist of Hipper's experience, as it indicates the possibility that the artist is seeking to break new ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For South Africans still confused about issues of censorship, social mores and sexuality, there is certainly food for thought and debate here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mark Hipper and Art Strip exhibitions are at the Association of Visual Arts in Cape Town until January 25</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HAZEL FRIEDMAN reports on a lengthy court action being waged by author/artist Pippa Skotnes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artist Pippa Skotnes unashamedly courts controversy with the enthusiasm of a moth to a flame. But her latest controversy has landed her in court. And this time her adversaries are the South African Library and an odious piece of legislation called the Legal Deposit Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three years Skotnes has been fighting a long and costly legal battle to prevent the state library from appropriating her acclaimed art book Sounds from the Thinking strings, which exposes the historical plight of South Africa's San community through images and text. At the centre of the conflict is the Legal Deposits Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This law requires that five copies of any published book be deposited in the so- called Legal Deposits Libraries in South Africa. Even if a few copies of the book have been reproduced, the publisher is legally obliged to supply the libraries. Only in special cases can a single copy be given, and this must be deposited in Cape Town's South African Library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skotnes's battle of the book began in 1992 when the State Library requested a copy of Sound from the thinking strings. She explained that the book was in a hand- produced artwork and could not be donated free of charge. She did say, however, that the matter was &quot;open to negotiation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The library disagreed. &quot;In 1993, under the direction of Piet Westra, from the South African library, a summons was pinned to my studio door demanding the book's recovery,&quot; she recalls. &quot;While I understand that the book forms part of South Africa's cultural heritage, in effect the Act compromises freedom of creative expression and the artist's right to ownership of creative production. It is therefore a matter of principle for artists to fight it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So began a series of court cases that saw Skotnes's initial victory (the magistrate ruled that her book was in fact an artwork and therefore exempt from the Legal Deposit Act) overturned in the Supreme Court. She has since taken her case to the Appeal Court in Bloemfontein where she will appear in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the Legal Deposits Bill, in theory anyway, upholds the very principles to which Skotnes clearly subscribes. Passed in South Africa during the 1970s and currently under review, the act aims to provide a public service by making information accessible to all. Yet it is sadly lacking in detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, it fails to define what constitutes a book. According to conventional dictionary definitions, a book is a &quot;portable written or printed work filling a number of sheets fastened together&quot;. But that definition precludes a portfolio which might consist of text but is not bound together.  Furthermore it fails to differentiate between conventional mass- produced publications and original books produced by artists. The latter are usually more costly to produce and are bought by specialised art institutions or collectors. They are often painstakingly hand-produced as unique artworks, or in limited numbers, using the book format as a medium, in much the same way as a piece of sculpture or installation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years artists' books - featuring images and text - have made enormous headway in the United States and Europe. Artists working in a variety of media and traditions regard this as a cheaper, more portable means of artistic expression. As such, artists' books should fall under the laws governing intellectual property, as they do in the US and Europe, excluding Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This issue does not simply involve one person but has enormous repercussions for the future of creative freedom in this country,&quot; says artist Malcolm Payne, who has championed Skotnes's cause by organising an auction in Cape Town to raise money for her legal costs. Linda Givon of the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg has offered to act as auctioneer. &quot;If Pippa loses her case, this will serve as the biggest disincentive to creative expression,&quot; says Givon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some artists believe Skotnes is &quot;morally obliged&quot; to donate her book to the library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While I admire Pippa's strength of principle I am convinced that if a book has pages, text, is printed in an edition and bound - it constitutes a book,&quot; says artist Judith Mason, herself the publisher of numerous artists' books. &quot; Unless it is an artist's edition, which is enormously expensive to produce and contains original artwork, it is the artist's responsibility to give a copy to the viciously cash- strapped public collections in South Africa, in order to make their work as accessible as possible to society.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After the serious web business of the past two weeks, it's time for some meaningful fun again. There are probably more web sites devoted to humour than to the meaning of life, so you never have to click too hard for a laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From send-up advice columns to tasteless jokes, from fortune cookies to advertising send-ups, your taste is bound to find someone catering for it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, of course, the state-of-the-art sites of the &quot;you-have-to-see- this&quot; variety. These include the official online home of the Monty Python team, namely PythOnline (http://www.pythonline.com/), not a place for the religious zealot nor the nervous aardvark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For something completely different in humour, click on over to The Gallery of Advertising Parody (http://www.dnai.com/ sharrow/parody.html), where potshots are taken at &quot;lame ads, dumb ads, ads that exploited everything from women to bald guys&quot;. The real punchline comes when you try to compare real ads with parody ads and have to decide which is which.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If conventional satire is more to your taste, you are a natural candidate for the Onion (http://www.theonion.com/), a weekly satirical newspaper that runs stories like the devastating strike by panhandlers - beggars - in Milwaukee, the end of television, and Nasa entering the racing circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For something a little more cerebral, try The Journal of Irreproducible Results (http://www.jir.com/index.htm), where scientists get their laughs.  Now in its 41st year, The JIR &quot;presents timeless satirical and critique articles emanating from and about the scientific and medical community that have enraged, confounded, amused, and fascinated thousands of subscribers throughout the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current contents include a paper entitled &quot;Relativity and Related Effects in Attorney Billing Practices&quot;, and provides a scientific explanation for why, in &quot;isolated instances&quot;, a lawyer has billed a client for more than 24 hours work in a single day. This is owing not to billing practices, but &quot; billing effects&quot; caused by a black hole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More traditional humour will leap at you from Comic Relief Online (http: &nbsp;//www.comic-relief.com/), an equal- opportunity offender that promises to make fun of all social, political, and religious orientations equally, &quot;as long as it's funny&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Britcomedy Digest (http://www.prairienet.org/britcom/BD/index .html) looks at the serious side of the funny business with a monthly online newsletter that focuses on British comedy in radio, television, books, film, and plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humour on the Internet wouldn't be complete without computer humour, and there is no worse place to start than The Bastard Operator from Hell: (http: &nbsp;//www.emap.com/nww/bofh.htm). &quot;Before you call the helpdesk, before you think about moving your PC, before you think about ... well, anything really, just remember - the Bastard Operator From Hell is probably watching you ...&quot; You won't want to hang around this guy too much, but the ideas you could get from him ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - DURING the past six months the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA), which consists of 14 committee members and operates on an annual budget of just less than R500 000, has received a total of 130 complaints. Some of these complaints are listed below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biased reporting: SABC 3 - The Chief, August at 9pm: A programme which dealt with abortion. Complaints were received from two significant sections of the local population - the members of most &quot;free churches&quot;, and the possible majority of the population who support the Pro-Life viewpoint.  Finding: Requested more details. No response received. Complaint dismissed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offensive material: SABC 3 - Point Blank, August 15 at 9.30pm: The complaint concerned foul language - most decent law- abiding citizens do not want to be exposed to &quot;gutter language&quot; in their homes. Finding: The broadcast amounted to a documentary on homosexuals and transvestites in a rural setting. Given the time of broadcast and the characters portrayed, the crudities did not transgress the code, were not accentuated and formed an integral part of the characters portrayed. Complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indecency/Bad taste: SABC 3 - The Works, August 13 at 9pm: The programme featured the drug Ecstacy. All commentators featured were favourably inclined to use the drug, except one. The presenters were attempting to cast themselves in the role of those totally sympathetic to the rave culture which fosters the use of this drug. Complaints were that the SABC was abetting this misguided and amoral attitude. Finding: People have different norms and that these were depicted in a programme does not amount to a contravention of the code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offensive to privacy or religious convictions: SABC TV news and Radio Swazi - July 23: Complainants said news coverage concerning deaths and infection of youths during circumcision and a phone-in programme on the issue encouraged perception of the custom as barbaric and was an invasion of privacy. Finding: The necessary sensitivity was shown in broadcasting customs considered secret.  The accent was on objective news and open discussion without transgression into the privacy of the custom itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harmful to children: SABC 3 - Side Effects, August 7 at 7pm: Programme about a gay couple who wanted to have a baby. Complainant said this was distasteful and should not be broadcast during family viewing time. Finding: No information given on channel or date of screening. Complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other complaints included one from Barend ''Witwolf&quot; Strydom who found a news clip offensive to the Afrikaner people as it featured the launch of a veteran society for Umkhonto weSizwe cadres; the SABC licence advert featuring a robocop or prison bars was distasteful; &quot;unhappiness&quot; about pronunciation of the English language; the repetition of local dramas was boring; adverts were irritating; and a Good Morning South Africa presenter having skew teeth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Certain TV programmes directed at children have provoked outrage from the public. Gillian Farquhar reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECENT complaints lodged with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) have once again raised the controversial issue of who or what dictates the parameters of programme content for child viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the most serious complaints received by the BCCSA involved &quot;obscene&quot; or &quot;shocking&quot; viewing for children and teenagers, with producers and advertisers expressing conflicting views on what is acceptable and what is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most producers interviewed by the Mail &amp; Guardian, whose programmes have been hauled before the BCCSA for being unfriendly towards children, argue that youngsters should not be shielded from the realities of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, advertisers have argued that broadcasting rules should be more stringent where children are involved, adding that content often affected advertising revenue. Clients, say advertisers, are particularly choosy when it comes to buying advertising time around controversial programmes which target children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BCCSA's latest findings, in response to a public complaint on obscene programming during time scheduled for children, was that the &quot;direct use of crude language for intercourse and oral sex on a programme for teenagers between 5.30 and 6pm&quot; was unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whether this decision, and the precedent it may set, is in the best interests of those it is supposed to protect, or whether it is just a harbinger from South Africa's repressed past, remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme Limits Unlimited recently came under fire from the BCCSA.  Broadcast on SABC 2 in September, the programme featured a documentary on child prostitution in Johannesburg and focused on prostitutes as young as 15 years old in Rosebank and Hillbrow sex shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crude language involving &quot;offending words&quot; was used by one of the young interviewees and a letter of complaint was speedily dispatched to the BCCSA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter, which smacked of rigid Calvinist morality, said &quot;the morals of society were being seriously eroded by such permissiveness&quot; and that the programme should have been broadcast later in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC manager of transmission planning, Kobus van den Berg, defended both the inclusion of the crude language and the time slot. He said the aim of the programme was to show teenagers the personal devastation and corruption that was the inevitable result of this lifestyle. Hearing a child speak in this way conveyed the message that prostitution was a bleak, harsh, futureless &quot; occupation&quot; for someone who is still a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Censoring the real language used would have killed the impact of the message, while changing the time slot would have missed the target audience,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Klerck &amp; Barrett media director Todd Wilson said the &quot;F- word&quot;, as in most Western countries, should be blocked out on free-to-air TV before 8.00pm. This time restriction would avoid exposing the pre-teen age group to crude footage and language and therefore will not encourage its use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child psychologist Dr Anne Marie Novello disagrees. &quot;Protecting children from all aspects of reality is not always in their best interests. Exposure to strong language does not necessarily increase its use in the same way that exposure to drugs does not naturally lead to using them,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-ordinator of the Cape Town Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (Sweat), Shane Petzer, dismissed the complaints of bad language and indecency as the mouthings of &quot;right-wing Christian fundamentalists&quot; who were now conveniently targeting television after failing in their anti-gay and anti- abortion drives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The F-word is used by children in playgrounds,&quot; he said, adding that the extent of child prostitution in South Africa has been blown out of proportion by the media and the public. There also exists a widespread public denial that children have sexual feelings, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limits Unlimited executive producer Sam Nakedi said it was the role of the public broadcaster to show the public the &quot;whole truth of the society we live in&quot;. Furthermore, he said, the youth needed exposure on air to controversial views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside Information, a youth actuality programme broadcast on SABC 2 during October at 2.30pm, certainly led to controversy. It screened an interview with a sangoma who said he murdered children and used their body parts in rituals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BCCSA, after receiving a complaint, found the programme content &quot;too disturbing&quot; for pre-teenagers to watch and thus unacceptable for afternoon viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioning editor Brenda Kali said the programme was aimed at raising awareness of a danger that was a reality for the majority of pre-teenage children in the country. She said this objective had to be put above &quot; offending the sensitivity of privileged viewers&quot;, adding that children themselves chose the topics for Inside Information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ogilvy &amp; Mather media director Yvonne Johnston disagreed with Kali on &quot; raising awareness&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnston felt that advertising could be affected as &quot;advertisers would probably not want to be associated with that type of editorial content&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson concurred that advertisers would probably want to avoid this type of programme. Research has shown that audience recall of commercials is likely to be poor during shock viewing. The broadcaster has to take responsibility for informing ad agencies if the content of programmes are likely to be controversial for the advertising market, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a BCCSA representative, the committee will soon meet to clarify more precisely in its Code of Conduct what &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;obscene&quot; broadcasting amounts to and will take the criteria of the new Films and Publications Act as guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If one looks at South African newspapers over the past few years, there are clearly some newspapers that are getting it right and some that are getting it wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten years ago the total number of newspapers sold was 3 342 839; this has increased marginally to 3 515 896 - a 5,2% growth. According to the All Media and Product Survey, over the same period the population grew by 25%. The newspapers which have shown the largest decreases are illustrated in the losers graph.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those newspapers which are winning have a formula which is working for them.  They are represented in the winners graph and a few are described in detail below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Sowetan's great strength has always been that it was a community newspaper for Soweto, coupled with the presence of Aggrey Klaaste. This positioned The Sowetan in the community as it was seen to be putting something back into the community. The Sowetan's appeal is that its editorial is both broad and focused. It covers local news, international news, yet has a community news page covering funerals, meetings, missing people and so forth. In addition, it provides added value through competitions. The real strength of The Sowetan lies in its sports coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* City Press has a circulation which is growing by leaps and bounds. Its success is based on a number of factors. It is an easy read and it provides added value through competitions - a regular feature with a wide variety of prizes. The editorial is people-oriented and includes The Social Scene, Showbiz and the Reader's Hotline, which has a community focus. The Learning Supplement in City Press is seen as a major benefit, more so than other education supplements. In addition, it is believed that Nasionale Pers has supplemented its traditional distribution with the use of franchised distributors in the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Citizen, which comes from a Nationalist government background, has found a formula which works. Most publishers believe this is owing to its strong horse-racing coverage. However, its formula of a quick read and tabloid format enables ease of reading for commuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, we are a newspaper-poor society, with a lack of diversity.  What South Africa needs is a dilution of existing monopolies and a broader diversity of newspapers which can serve their communities and produce a healthier newspaper environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lyndall Campher, Hunt Lascaris group media director, gives a fortnightly analysis of print media circulation, alternating with M&amp;G media editor Jacquie Golding-Duffy's look at television ratings</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A battle is brewing between M-Net and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) following the former's refusal to respond to a complaint lodged by the SABC that M- Net is contravening its licence conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M-Net this week argued in its lawyers' response to the IBA's Broadcasting Monitoring and Complaints Committee that the SABC's complaint was lodged too late in terms of the IBA Act. Head of the monitoring department, Bronwyn Keene-Young, in a written response to M-Net, argued that the pay channel will have to attend a hearing where the issue of the 30-day deadline will be addressed. Should the SABC's complaint be upheld then M-Net will have to justify providing a broadcasting service without a licence during its window time as well as benefiting from advertising during its open time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Editors Forum (BEF) this week held talks with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on the issue of the Freedom of Expression Institute heading an investigation into the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEF secretary Mike Tissong said the BEF was opposed to organisations generating revenue under the pretence of assisting the commission. He says caution should be exercised since nothing stops other organisations from seeking permission from the commission and then using this freedom to boost their own coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Muslim Party has pledged support for the BEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Media Workers Association of South Africa (Mwasa) has reacted with amusement to the formation of a new union at the Independent Newspaper Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new body, called the Independent Newspapers Staff Association (Insa), is a sweetheart union formed and run by management, argue Mwasa representatives. In a press statement, it says the new union is even offering lower subscription rates than its rivals, but the Mail &amp; Guardian was unable to contact any of the Insa representatives to confirm or deny the claims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE new role of South African auditing firms as neutral referees on the local Internet is a first step towards more credible figures.  But a second step is still required - public dissemination of those figures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisers need access to figures from a range of competing publications, all audited in the same way, as a means of assessing electronic publications against one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interests of encouraging this second step, the Electronic Mail &amp; Guardian's director, Irwin Manoim, has made public the newly audited figures for our online site, and challenges his rivals to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deloitte &amp; Touche have abandoned the common measuring standard - the number of &quot;hits&quot; on a site - as too easily manipulated, and have proposed instead two standards:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;page accesses&quot;, the number of articles read; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;visitors&quot;, the number of times the publication has been read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the M&amp;G's figures, as audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche: November: 247 961 page accesses and 88 364 visitors; December: 200 801 page accesses and 79 905 visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Manoim: &quot;The December figure is lower than November as most people spend the holiday period as far away as possible from their computers. But the more typical November figure is, we believe, well ahead of our publishing industry rivals, and we challenge them to produce equivalent figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For too long, sites with fewer visitors than our own have managed to confuse advertising agencies into believing spurious figures.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Advertising agencies may finally be lured into marketing their goods more vigorously on the Internet, as the major South African auditing firms move into the arena to provide more &quot;honest&quot; electronic publishing statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet has been both the most measurable of media and the least credible. As all operations are computerised, electronic publishers can provide advertisers with far more detailed information about their readers than other media. It is also possible to provide limited demographic information about which countries readers come from, and what fields they are in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Internet is also the least credible medium for two reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The publishers themselves have produced the figures until now and there has been no independent verification. At least half-a- dozen South African sites claim to be the &quot;most visited&quot; in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Different publishers have used different measuring yardsticks, and advertisers have often been unaware that pears have been compared to apples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last two months, major auditing companies such as Deloitte &amp; Touche and Coopers &amp; Lybrand have offered their services as neutral and unbiased compilers of online statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deloitte &amp; Touche has opened a Strategic Internet Consulting division, which aims to set a standard for web sites, allowing for a benchmark to be established which ensures that everyone is comparing the same figures, says Dominique Pousson, Deloitte &amp; Touche's Internet marketing manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pousson says the company's service is to provide a third-party guarantee to advertisers, allowing them to get a fair reflection of the site's popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media directors at various advertising agencies are excited by the new development. &quot;Moves into Internet auditing by reputable accounting firms will greatly assist media planners, buyers and strategists as they are able to provide clients with concrete unbiased statistics,&quot; said one media director.  Another director agreed, saying that Internet advertising has not taken off, as yet, because of scepticism about the certainty of statistics provided by the web site promoters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coopers &amp; Lybrand senior manager of computer assurance services Michael Wright agrees that web sites lack credibility as some publishers have doctored their figures which advertisers have been unable to rely on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now advertisers are able to see exactly whether the rates they are being charged by any one particular web site is reasonable or not, proportional to the number of people who access that particular web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistical analysis and assurance are the key functions provided by accounting firms, says Wright, adding that web statistics are also useful to technical staff managing the web site, who need to assess traffic congestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deloitte &amp; Touche has such clients as the Mail &amp; Guardian, Business Day and Business Times, and the major corporate Internet service provider, The Internet Solution. Deloitte &amp; Touche is also holding talks with the Independent Group with an eye on The Star's online service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coopers &amp; Lybrand has two clients, an online-only independent business journal called Woza, and the E-Data web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times Media Limited electronic publishing manager Roy Isacowitz says the reason TML uses Deloitte &amp; Touche is largely for credibility. &quot;We can easily produce our own results but we do not expect the public or advertisers to take our word. But if they get the results from a reputable firm, then we are going a long way in ensuring that advertisers have accurate figures which they are entitled to if we want them to advertise on our site.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media directors say the stamp of approval from accounting firms will encourage potential clients to consider using the medium to advertise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The bar in what used to be the Quirinale Hotel, with its zebra-striped walls and languidly spinning fans, lies quiet and empty. Gone are the hotel's notorious days of pulsing musical acts that played on the elevated stage, the chance of picking up a prostitute, scoring some coke or rubbing shoulders with agents from some of the old government's most notorious hit squads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the former bar hosts monthly meetings of the 11-storey building's new tenants, where they can talk of leaky faucets or garbage pick-up. In what used to be the Quirinale's kitchen, workers tap away at wall tiles as part of converting the space into a creche. Tiny toilets that don't reach your knee await the use of tenants' children when the creche opens in February.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillbrow's Quirinale Hotel, once the city's most famous den of vice and intrigue, has been converted into a low-cost housing project for hotel and catering workers. The shift from social blight to what some see as a showcase for responsible social investment is an example of how labour union assets can be utilised in ways other than pouring them into the marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last February, the Hospitality Industry Pension Provident Fund (HIPPF), which controls about R120- million in assets from the retirement funds of restaurant and catering workers, purchased the Quirinale to convert it to housing for its members. In July, tenants began moving into the 140 flats of what has been renamed Badiri House (Badiri is the seTswana word for workers).  Today, 150 people are on a waiting list to move in, said Allan Kolski Horwitz, who acts as principal officer of HIPPF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horwitz, who drives a beat-up reddish car and considers poetry his true calling, began working with hotel and catering workers' unions in the mid- 1980s and later became active in the civic association of Johannesburg. In choosing to utilise a portion of workers' assets to meet social needs, Horwitz has taken a different path from many of the labour militants of the 1980s, who have enthusiastically entered the world of big business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offers Cyril Ramaphosa as an example of the other breed of labour leaders: a man who shot to prominence in 1985 when he led the biggest strike in South African to protect black miners from mass retrenchment on the mines and now says his New African Investment Limited (Nail) corporation will not invest its assets, including a significant chunk of worker savings, in the ailing mining industry because the returns were not likely to be good enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thrust of unions' work now is no longer the interests of the workers, but to support the growth of the black business class,&quot; said Horwitz. In the past, a key goal of the unions was to improve the lives of workers, secure jobs and democratise the nation; now, the goal is to maximise returns, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While investors representing unions ranging from the National Union of Mineworkers to Ikhwezi have chosen to invest their assets in media outlets, breweries and a wide range of other businesses, HIPPF has sunk more than R30- million into such projects as Badiri House, a low-interest housing loan programme and Nhlanganani, a project that will eventually see construction of 400 houses for fund members, in the Diepsloot area north of Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horwitz sees the union's pension and provident funds, estimated by one analyst at about R50-million, as a great untapped pool for &quot;social investment&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If every fund put in just 10% of its assets, we'd be talking about a hell of a lot of money,&quot; said Horwitz. And a hell of a lot of housing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The phenomenon of unions and their related investment companies making major investments in the South African economy has only emerged in the past couple of years. But in that time, unions have become major shareholders in a wide range of industries, from breweries to media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the best-known of unions' ventures into business investments is their role in the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC), which purchased Johnnic.  The NEC is half controlled by various non-union shareholders, the largest of which are Worldwide Africa Investment Holdings, Metropolitan Life and Siphumelele Investments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other half is owned by unions and their related investment companies.  Of these, the National Union of Mineworkers owns just under 5% of Johnnic, the South African Railway and Harbour Workers Union owns about 3,5% and 13 other union investors control a total of about 9,5% of the company. These unions represent workers in industries ranging from clothing and textiles to food processing, from printing to construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnnic has a wide range of holdings. It owns 28% of South African Breweries, which accounts for at least 60% of Johnnic's asset base, 27% of Premier and 43% of Omni Media, among other investments. Last year it sold its 26% share in Toyota SA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omni Media controls 91% of Times Media Limited, which has major interests in The Sunday Times, The Daily Dispatch, The Evening Post and other media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Johnnic dealings, the Mineworkers Investment Company and the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union Investment Group share ownership of Francolin Investments Limited, which has major ownership of Africa on Air, and through it, Highveld Radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unions have made significant investments in Real Africa Investments Limited (Rail). Investors include mine workers, textile workers and the Metal Industries Provident Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although union investors have strong interests in the media, at least one analyst believes this has more to do with high earnings potential in that area as opposed to other goals of furthering workers' interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unionists come from &quot;alternative&quot; backgrounds, but their main investment concern in the past two years appears to be making &quot;hot-shot investments,&quot; said Steven Friedman, director of the Centre for Policy Studies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Labour is debating investment schemes and how they can benefit union members.Eddie Koch and Jim Day report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Neil Aggett, the union activist who died in a John Vorster Square prison cell in early 1982 after being tortured by men from the special branch, was busy mobilising workers into the African Food and Canning Workers' Union during a period of renaissance for organised labour in the early Seventies, his rank-and-file members often complained that he came to meetings in sandals, faded jeans and a limp T-shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fears of those workers who worried that their organiser's dress code would cause company executives not to take the union seriously, may well be soothed by the new sartorial style that is sweeping through organised labour in the late-1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days one-time militants wake up in the morning, fasten their brightly coloured ties into the Windsor knot and don double- breasted suits before travelling into the headquarters of the country's most powerful corporations in a bid to buy out the bosses they used to bash in those boardrooms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some sectors of the labour movement, along with a group of intellectuals who help shape its strategies, are becoming increasingly concerned that the growing band of silk-and-suit socialists as well as the vehicles they are using to drive into the top echelons of the South African economy - the trade union investment company - are beginning to undermine the values that Aggett and his many compatriots used to galvanise the power of organised labour in the 1970s and 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sudden proliferation of companies that have been set up over the last year in order to invest workers' retirement savings - a huge stash of cash sitting in various pension and provident funds estimated to be worth between R50-billion and R100-billion - in new black empowerment consortia has occurred without attracting much attention within the trade union movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are signals that the quiescence is about to change. The South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers' Union (Saccawu), one of the biggest affiliates of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), has called a special congress early next month specifically to air a growing debate about the wisdom of going down the investment company route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the South African Labour Bulletin, a journal that has helped shape trade union policy over the last two decades, recently published a critical appraisal of organised labour's latest fad - and is planning to follow up with more in-depth scrutiny of the way worker savings are being used by labour leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To put it in a nutshell,&quot; says the secretary general of a union who asked not to be named, &quot;the debate is between those who see investing worker retirement funds in big business as a new way to further the aims of socialism, that is for workers to control the means of production by buying them, and those who see this tactic as a sell-out by people who are looking for a new route to become upwardly mobile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour Bulletin article, published late last year and bylined to a &quot; special correspondent&quot;, was the first serious effort to examine the obsession with creating investment companies that now characterises trade union organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anonymous author criticises the strategy on four grounds: it is shrouded in secrecy and confusion; it places ordinary peoples' hard-earned savings in high-risk investments; it could enrich a new but small bourgeoise instead of empowering the poor; and it commercialises the ethics of a movement that once relied on solidarity and collective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In no other area of union life is there such conceptual confusion as surrounds these companies. There are currently as many motivations as there a fleas to a dog ... Secrecy surrounds many of the union initiatives and in many cases one union- owned company is bound to be competing with another or with the African National Congress investment companies,&quot; the article says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An impromptu survey conducted by the Mail &amp; Guardian this week reinforced this conclusion. Many unions were reluctant to disclose details about their investment companies' strategies. Officials who did speak insisted their comments stay strictly off the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumours also abound that Cosatu has shacked up with a consortium that is bidding to buy the tourism parastatal Aventura, the state's first effort at selling off one of its assets, while Cosatu's leadership insists it is opposed to privatisation. Nobody could clarify the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether by design or because of the willy- nilly way in which this strategy is unfolding, workers are losing control of the way in which their funds are being used,&quot; said a senior official in one Cosatu union. &quot;Even more disturbing are signs that the lack of public scrutiny is opening the way for a great deal of insider trading in the way these deal are being set up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour Bulletin paper points out that, in straight economic terms, the current strategy involves high-risk investment in long-term ventures that are unlikely to yield tangible benefits to rank-and-file members in the short term. &quot;Through investment companies, unions are becoming intimately tied up with companies and management. It is one thing to make a portfolio investment, and quite another to form a partnership with a particular management group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter method of investing worker savings involves creation of companies that may only begin paying dividends in 10 years, unlike short-term pension fund investments that generate immediate returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two recent developments substantiate the warning. The Thebe Investment Corporation this week announced it was withdrawing from the African Mining Consortium, which has just bought JCI. Thebe apparently based its decision on fears that it would not have sufficient power on the board of the gold mining house to safeguard the interests of its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Empowerment Consortium (NEC), a major association of trade union investment companies and big black-owned businesses, is reportedly also under pressure to unlock value from its stake in Johnnic if it is to retain control of its 35% holding in the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complex financing arrangements to fund the R2,7-billion black empowerment deal means institutional loans could convert to equity if it failed to achieve sufficient growth. Thus, in the long run, the NEC runs the risk of losing some of its stake in Johnnic and its plans to use ownership of the corporation as a vehicle for black empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author of the Labour Bulletin article points out there is a key difference between New African Investments Limited (Nail), the emblem of black economic empowerment in South Africa, and the way in which Afrikaner nationalists used white workers' money to create Sanlam and buy their way into an economy dominated at the time by English capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's useful to compare Nail with two models for Afrikaner economic empowerment - Sanlam and Rembrandt. Sanlam and its sister companies empowered Afrikaners through widespread ownership and a shared vision. In the case of Rembrandt, the Rupert and Hertzog families attracted the savings of their people on a 'trust' basis,&quot; says the author.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Both companies acquired enormous wealth. But Sanlam is still a mutual company which is owned by its policy holders, while the Rupert and Hertzog families have used a pyramid structure to retain control and have amassed vast personal wealth. Sanlam invests mainly in South Africa, while Rembrandt's main focus today is overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are disturbing signs that the control structure at Nail follows the Rembrandt model. The company has a seven-layered pyramid structure that ultimately invests ownership with a company called Corporate Africa that has just four shareholders: Nthato Motlana, Dikgang Moseneke, Cyril Ramaphosa and Jonty Sandler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent newspaper article estimates that these four men, who have effective control over the black empowerment giant, are together worth a staggering R150-million (see graphic).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Bond, senior partner at the National Institute for Economic Policy, agrees that current investment patterns in the unions involve a high degree of risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points out that the Afrikaner nationalist strategy worked at an economic level, even though it may have weakened the power and influence of white trade unions, because it took place at a time when share prices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were at an all-time low, interest rates were rock bottom and the economy was emerging from a period of depression into a period of sustained and vibrant growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything except the rhetorical environment is working against them. They are buying shares of companies whose stock market prices are so overinflated compared to historical norms, and to do so they are borrowing at the highest real interest rates in modern history. They are buying into the system when the economy is stagnant, with no prospects for dramatic expansion,&quot; says Bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Compare these to the conditions for accumulation by Afrikaners half-a- century ago, when every one of these factors was reversed, and it is easy to be pessimistic about the depth and reach of black economic empowerment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rest of the debate is more familiar. Union leaders, the sceptics say, are being bought off by corporate and commercial values. The brain-drain that began when the cream of organised labour's leadership went into parliament is escalating as a new road opens up for unionists to move out of their low-paid jobs and dingy offices. Massive conflicts of interest will arise when workers engage in collective action to resolve labour disputes in industries in which where their unions own a major share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says the Labour Bulletin article: &quot;The approach could inflict lasting damage on the union movement in another way: it introduces commercial values into a social movement. Unionism is not about making money. It is about social issues, about using worker solidarity at plant, industry and national level to improve living and working conditions. This has no commercial rationale. Yet involvement in investment companies inserts commercial values which tend to squeeze out union values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critics are not advocating a return to the heady days when badly dressed men and women sacrificed their livelihoods and their lives, sometimes literally, to build such collective values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They believe there are alternative ways to invest worker savings that have a chance to bring real benefits to rank-and-file members, while at the same time strengthening their movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they fear that, because far too little is being done to plan and strategise how best do this, the future of this country's economy will be shaped by the the rhetoric of worker empowerment rather than its reality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Six-and-a-half years later and R55-million richer, one diamond player has made its fortune, reports Bronwen Jones</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors have given another much needed capital injection into the economy with the purchase of one of South Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 500 diamond mining concerns. The Canadian-based, but Bahamas-registered, Becksham Coporation recently acquired Messina Investments for R68,52-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Becksham has, however, just been reversed into dormant company Whispering Lake, that then changed its name to Messina Diamond Corporation ... which is now quoted on that haven of exploration capital, the Toronto Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convoluted? Danie Kirsten, who was managing director of Messina Investments, doesn't even know what his job title is at the moment. But with his share of the profit of the previous management teams' 57% shareholding in the company, he just beams and says: &quot;It's a success.&quot; The difference between the original purchase price some six-and-a-half years ago, adding in a rights issue along the way, and the sale figure of Messina, is around R55-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina has charted a chequered path since the main company was founded in 1904 and a major chunk was sold off to Impala Platinum in 1989. A management buy-out secured the copper, diamond and coal interests in 1990 for R12,5- million, and it is this that became Messina Investments, also known as Minvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large copper mine that was Messina's original raison d'etre closed in 1993 and rehabilitation will be complete by the middle of this year. Messina Investments mainly focused its attention on diamonds, and steadily sold off the coal properties including N'Komati and Anthra Colliery. One remaining site, Van Oudshoornstroom Coal, east of Ermelo in Mpumalanga, was explored but not worked. It has recently been sold to Anker Kolen of the Netherlands, giving Messina a R3,18-million profit on the book value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Venter, Anker's managing director in South Africa, said that with the increasing difficulty of getting coal from the big mining houses, the only logical move was for Anker to come into the country and buy its own mine.  More purchases will follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina's two operating diamond mines are at Bellsbank, north of Kimberley in the Northern Cape, bought in August 1991, and the other, Star Diamonds, south of Virginia in the Free State. Star was bought in July 1992 from Loucas Pouroulis's Salene Mining for R8,3-million. The mine was previously unprofitable, coming with a R20,5-million tax loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike normal kimberlite pipe deposits, the diamonds at Star and at Bellsbank are found in fissures. The company said at the time: &quot;It will be about another five years before Star has to pay tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirsten told Mining Journal: &quot;We're very much into finalising the exploration phase for another diamond mine in north-east Lesotho, known as Liqhobong.&quot; Involved kimberlite diamond mining, the company has already spent $3-million of a $10-million exploration plan that will be complete by 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Botswana, Messina secured some licences for a base metals project - predominantly copper - and has spent &quot;a bit more than $1-million&quot; on boreholes and other exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was this project that Messina claims led it to seek an overseas partner &quot; because South African exchange controls became a problem for moving the money that would be entitled in development&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina and Becksham &quot;decided it would be a good thing if we put our resources together. We have shares in things that they are into and vice versa.&quot; Becksham was the majority shareholder in Liqhobong in Lesotho, in which Messina was acquiring a 20% interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, a company called Mortbury Limited, essentially British and registered in the Channel Islands, bought Messina's Bushman Copper mineral licences in Botswana, giving Messina in return a 21% equity stake and a preference dividend to 11,5% of the net profits of the Messina Copper (Botswana).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirsten says: &quot;Mortbury introduced us to Becksham but they are not the same organisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Botswanan project, north-west of Francistown, has been extensively explored before by Canadian concern Falconbridge and other companies, who were put off by the lack of infrastructure in the area. This has been remedied and makes the project infinitely more viable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a lot of companies are considering new copper mines, Kirsten said: &quot; One must not just look at what's coming on stream, but also remember what falls offstream. Copper tubing is becoming very important again in building in Europe.&quot; And he joked, &quot;with all the cable theft in South Africa there's an increasing secondary market in copper too&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina held a two day meeting in South Africa this week with its new president Jeremy Clarke. The new chair, David Jones, and board members Clive Johnson, Normand Lamarche, Marvin Singer and Anthony Williams are expected here by February 10 when the takeover becomes final. There is no South African on the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what will Kirsten, former chair Tony Buchan and former company secretary Peter Freeman do with their new-found wealth? &quot;Invest it in mining, probably.&quot; But they're not saying where.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Messina shares were suspended on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in December. In September last year, it reported post-tax income of R5,6-million (R3,2-million in 1995). Earnings per share were 41c (21,6c) and a 10,25c (5c) dividend was declared.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Imaginative alternatives are needed to deal with poverty, argues Jeremy Baskin. And he has a particularly bold one to offer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNEMPLOYMENT and poverty are arguably the biggest challenges facing South Africa. And yet there is a startling paucity of ideas on how to tackle them.  Certainly there are lots of specific ideas that could make a difference - ending state subsidies of capital-intensive farming; promoting small, medium and micro-enterprises; encouraging tourism; to name only a few. But one hears about few big ideas, major structural innovations that could have an impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only serious idea is the call for deregulation of the labour market.  Reduce the cost of hiring and more will be hired, is the simple version of the argument. More generally, the government is urged to increase labour market flexibility, push down the level of unskilled wages, and make it easier to hire, fire and retrench employees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is hard to see this idea as practical. It seriously overestimates the current inflexibility of the labour market. And it only makes sense if it is not watered down. To work, it would require the government to take on and &quot; tame&quot; the labour movement, and, in doing so, increase the level of conflict in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it really practical to pursue policies which promise the long-term possibility of employment and economic growth but, in the short and medium- term, increase earning inequalities, income disparities and social conflict?  Are policies which do not also encourage the re-integration of our divided society, which do not build social cohesion, really sustainable?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is relatively easy to critique the labour market deregulationists. But, in truth, few progressive alternatives have emerged. We need to heed the warning of the Indian philosopher Ashis Nandy when he says &quot;the surest guarantee of oppression is the inability to imagine alternatives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So imagine the following - a basic income for all. Every adult citizen of South Africa (18 years and older) is given a monthly transfer of, say, R150 from the fiscus. This amount is given to all citizens, is not means-tested, and comes with no strings attached. It is a social entitlement linked to the general obligations of citizenship. This R150 is paid monthly into the bank account of each citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a modest sum, to be drawn and used by the individual as needed. It is paid to all citizens, partly for practical reasons (to avoid bureaucracy, inspectors, and the possibilities of corruption etc), but mainly to give expression to the notion that citizenship is also about the obligations each South African has to every other. It can be a glue helping bind South Africans, and assisting the development of a common national purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can we afford it? Is it practical in rural areas or if people don't have bank accounts? Why should Harry Oppenheimer also get it? These questions are partly answered by listing some of the advantages of the basic income idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* First, it will help alleviate the most extreme forms of poverty.  Households have an average of three or four adults. For the most destitute households, and there are many, this is a form of direct income transfer that will at least keep some of the worst effects of hunger from the door. The amount is modest but will make a real impact on poverty and malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Second, by beginning to reduce absolute poverty and tackle inequality, a basic income should contribute to social cohesion and the reduction of crime.  The extent to which it does so would, of course, depend on the amount of the transfer. Indirect effects, such as the promotion of productivity gains, might also be expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Third, the amount suggested is low enough not to stop anyone looking for a job, but significant enough to make people willing to work for less than they might have. This means it should not act as a disincentive to employment.  And it should moderate pressure on labour costs, but without reducing incomes at the bottom end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Fourth, it should change the power balance within the family and increase its social cohesion. The individual autonomy and self-respect which the basic income system encourages should empower women and younger people within the family. In many ways the aim is to replicate some of the positive effects seen in the transfers of state pensions to the elderly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Fifth, it would bring all citizens into the financial system and could act as a disincentive to unregistered economic activity and associated evasion of taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sixth, it could result in a range of direct savings by, for example, reducing the size of the civil service (removing means-testing and making electronic transfers allows for leaner and cheaper delivery); cutting some existing transfer payments (although this is not inherent in a basic income system); avoiding the duplicate costs of other citizenship systems (such as election voting rolls and identity documentation); and improving the revenue system. Indirect savings from enhanced social stability could also be substantial but are harder to measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Seventh, it is an attempt to develop a basic safety net for all citizens in a situation of limited state bureaucratic capacity. It recognises that it is not affordable or sustainable to attempt to develop and expand existing transfer systems on the West European welfare model. These systems are, in any case, under pressure and there is widespread agreement they must be reformed. Nor do we have the state capacity to deliver a complex and means- tested system of transfers efficiently and effectively, even if this were desirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Eighth, it should boost the level of demand for basic commodities and, if responded to by domestic manufacturers, this should act as an economic stimulus. The economic multiplier effect could be significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before looking at costs, let us tackle some obvious queries. This &quot;crazy&quot; idea is not entirely new. It has been promoted internationally by a range of progressive economists, including two Nobel Prize winners. It has been referred to variously as a basic or citizenship income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic income idea need not substitute for all existing welfare transfers. There is clearly a case for retaining some specific transfers which are conditional or means-tested. Indeed, in principle, a basic income transfer can co-exist with other welfare transfers, although there are cost implications in maintaining multiple systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a basic income system could be introduced incrementally. It could be phased in by age cohort, by region, or in other ways. Gradual implementation may make the system more affordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our problems need radical solutions and the basic income proposal is clearly a radical one. But there is one major and obvious question that it must confront. How much will it cost?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detailed costings would depend on the details of its design - whether it is implemented gradually, the amount of the transfer, whether it replaces existing welfare transfers, and so on. And it would be essential to adjust the income tax of those earning above, say, R1 000 per month in order to neutralise the effect of the transfer on second and third quintile income earners. For those in the middle- class and above (say earning R4 000 per month upwards) it would be essential to reclaim more than the R150 transfer in order to help pay for the transfer system as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If one assumes there are 20-million South Africans above the age of 18 years, and that one would reclaim the transfer and half the cost of the balance in the form of taxes from the wealthier 50% of citizens, then a transfer of R150 per month would amount to R9-billion per annum (10-million times by R1 800 per annum = R18-billion divided by two = R9-billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This figure can be reduced to the extent that existing welfare transfers and associated administrative personnel are reduced. Clearly a basic income system does not come cheap and detailed costings are needed. But the potential benefits for society, the sealing of a social contract between citizens and between generations, clearly merits further exploration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Minister of Public Enterprises Stella Sigcau is to make an announcement early next month on Eskom's new chair and members of its board, the Electricity Council, her representative said. The parastatal's current chair, Johan Maree, is expected to stand down in the next two months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyril Ramaphosa has been a hot favourite to succeed him, although there has been speculation that he is too busy for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU/SA trade talks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* January 24 will see the start of another lengthy round of trade negotiations between the European Union and South Africa. Negotiators from South Africa are hoping to convince EU members, who are under heavy pressure from European farm lobbyists, to allow South African agricultural goods greater access to the continent. The EU has suggested that 39% of South Africa's agricultural exports be excluded from any trade deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buoyant rand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The rand continued its bull run, firming by 2 cents against the dollar at the time of going to press trading at R4,615. The latest rally has come on the back of off- shore dollar selling according to traders. The remarkable feature of the rand's new- found life is its performance against a strong dollar, dealers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local unit took a bit of a tumble against sterling and was trading at R7,52, the government's benchmark bond, the R150, was at15,45%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disregard for Act</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Research by the University of Pretoria has shown that only 3% of listed companies fully adhered to the requirements of the Companies Act with regard to the disclosure of remuneration paid to the auditor in 1994. According to the report, comparative figures for the three years indicate that the trend is worsening.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But analysts say it is common knowledge in the industry that Kahn will happily accept a reasonable offer for the business. Union leaders are due to meet OK at the end of this month to discuss possible sale plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other analysts say SAB, which controversially delisted OK in 1994 in order to quietly restructure, is reluctant to publicly admit OK is open for buyers, so tacitly admitting defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two British groups - Tesco and Sainsbury - have been touted as possible buyers. Tesco, whose target market is similar to OK's, refused to confirm or deny reports that it was on the prowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, union sources say that executives from several overseas firms have been spotted on the shopfloor in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK has long been the weak link in SAB's chain of businesses - it made a R1- million loss in the 1996 financial year on sales of R6,1-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the six months to September 1996, however, it is believed to have sustained losses of around R20-million (as an unlisted company it does not have to detail results). Analysts expect it to lose up to R70-million for the year to March 1997 - hit by its heavy debt burden, lower consumer spending and tightening competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK Bazaars, which runs The Hyperama and OK Stores, has been plagued for years by poor management and heavy debt, analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAB's shortcomings included weak management, run-down stores, an unmanageable logistics system and badly trained personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should a foreign retail firm buy into OK Bazaars it would represent the first foreign investment in the sector since the election - heralding a competitive environment players such as Pick 'n Pay have been anticipating for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The involvement by Tesco in particular would be intriguing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The listed retail chain spent much of the late 1970s and early 1980s attempting to recreate itself. It is now one of Europe's largest supermarket businesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Allegations of insider trading could sour Nissan manufacturer's delisting from the JSE, writes Max Gebhardt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stormy relations between Automakers and investors entered a new phase this week with accusations that it botched its delisting announcement - opening the door to massive insider trading and heralding an embarrassing official investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The share price of the group, which manufactures Fiat and Nissan cars, bolted last Thursday amid talk that its main shareholder, Sankorp, was about to strike a deal with a foreign partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fingers have been pointed at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) for failing to agree to a request by Automakers to delist the share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sources close to the JSE say Automakers only contacted the exchange after the share's abnormal moves - lunchtime on Thursday. By then two million shares had traded and the price had motored from R2 to R2,80. In the previous 12 months, an average of 190 000 shares a day had been traded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JSE officials said that in any case it would not have been appropriate to freeze the share. According to JSE rules such a request can only be granted in very particular circumstances including where there are &quot;two levels of information in the market, or if the situation cannot be remedied by an immediate announcement ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the exchange's advice, Automakers that afternoon released a strongly worded statement which, unusually, urged dealers not to trade the counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following Monday the group announced the company would be delisting the share ahead of bringing on board an international player - almost certainly Nissan Japan as Fiat has denied it wants to return to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the move would be accompanied by a huge payout for minority shareholders - 411c a share for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">66,6-million shares, giving Sankorp an 87% stake in the group. There is speculation Sankorp will sell this stake to the foreign partner, in line with its drive to cut investments in operations outside its core financial services business to no more than 15%. Sankorp boss Marinus Daling has made clear his dissatisfaction with the performance of Automakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Securities Regulation Panel (SRP) told the Mail &amp; Guardian it would be &quot; irresponsible&quot; not to to investigate. SRP officials declined further comment, but unconfirmed reports suggest the probe focuses on a family member of a senior Automakers executive, who allegedly tipped off friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automakers chair John Newbury said he could not comment on those rumours or on why the JSE had not suspended the share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's share was one of the exchange's worst performers last year, plummeting as low as 214c last August after starting life at 565c.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this dismal performance and the decision to embark on a major retrenchment programme at its Pretoria plant last October, it emerged last year the group had poured millions of rands into three exclusive holiday resorts, including a retreat at exclusive Leopard Creek golfing resort in Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has been hit by a number of external factors, including the rand's collapse which has kicked up import costs, and increased competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with notoriously flaccid legislation, the SRP has yet to see one insider trading case prosecuted despite the JSE's widespread reputation for being a hotbed of leaked information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Police Service recently announced that an investigation into insider trading by former Malbak executive chair Grant Thomas was unlikely to lead to any prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, incoming JSE president Russell Loubser vowed this week to crack down on insider trading with &quot;draconian legislation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SRP executive director Richard Connellan said the task group chaired by business guru and former judge Mervyn King had agreed on the principles for new legislation on insider trading. They planned to open up a civil line of attack against insider trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent United States survey of 1 700 company executives, 42% admitted that if equipped with material inside information they would purchase shares themselves; 14% would tell a friend; and 56% would do nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - A TICK that has a toxin in its saliva that can kill animals may also have, in this secretion, a compound that can be used to treat human diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sandtampan tick, common to the arid regions of the Northern Cape, lives, like most ticks, on the blood of its host.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when it attaches to the skin of its victim and begins to suck, an anti-coagulant in its saliva prevents the blood from clotting and keeps it flowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pharmaceutical companies are constantly looking for new anti-coagulants,&quot; says AW Neitz, one of a team of biochemists from the University of Pretoria presenting their research on the Sandtampan's saliva at the conference in Grahamstown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-coagulants are often used to treat heart disease, as they present blood from clotting and clogging up the arteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But testing the anti-coagulant in ticks is finicky work. First, the researchers have to collect the ticks - at least 400 of them - then they put each one under a microscope and carefully detach their salivary glands. The glands are ground up and an extract is made from them, which yields a very little amount to work with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This substance will contain several hundred different compounds, so complicated procedures are applied to separate the anti-coagulant and get it pure. Only at this point can research begin on the anti- coagulant itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tick may be dangerous in the veld, but under the microscope it is a fairly simple creature to deal with. &quot;It's not like a spider that's aggressive. It's a fairly slow-moving creature so there's little danger of being bitten,&quot; says Neitz.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - MALARIA was the disease that in colonial times led to West Africa being dubbed &quot;the white man's graveyard&quot;. The discovery of the white powder that put a check on it - quinine - helped the European powers to conquer Africa, but malaria itself was never conquered and today the search is still on for drugs that can defeat one of Africa's biggest killers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quinine was discovered in the bark of a South American tree, but not by any scientific method - it was the knowledge of local people of the healing properties of the tree that led Western medicine to the solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not surprising, therefore, that the Antimalarial Plant Research Unit of Groote Schuur Hospital returns to first principles in looking for cures for malaria and other diseases. In a paper this week, the unit's Dr Motlalepula Matsabisa argued that traditional herbal remedies should be examined by the biomedical sciences for their healing properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He proposed information should be collected from local people on the medicinal plants they use, and entered in a database. The plants should then be examined for chemical compounds that could be used as the basis for developing drugs to treat, among other things, malaria and tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means taking the plants into the laboratory setting, isolating all the different chemical compounds they are made of and experimenting with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Matsabisa said there had been &quot;varying degrees of resistance&quot; over the years from traditional healers about giving up their knowledge: &quot;A number of issues, in particular, intellectual property rights, will need to be addressed if a harmonious relationship is to develop between the traditional healers and the scientists wishing to study their discipline.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - EXECUTIVE OUTCOMES has fought many gun battles in Africa.  Today the controversial company, having brought new meaning to the concept of the &quot;corporate state&quot; by mustering what is arguably the world's first corporate army, is again at war, only this one is of words, fought in the arena of public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is six years since Executive Outcomes emerged as a mercenary force to be reckoned with in Africa. Even now, as Zaire threatens to implode, there is speculation (denied by the company) that their mercenaries are moving in to shore up the crumbling rule of President Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Feared&quot; mercenaries, one is tempted to say. There is no doubt that Executive Outcomes's dogs of war are feared by some. But for others the name has come to mean security and stability - a private Pan- African peace- keeping force of a kind which the international community has long promised, but failed to deliver.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And therein lies the puzzle of this army without a country. Does it represent the privatisation of peace-keeping ? Or the privatisation of war?  Is it a means of bandaging Africa's wounds and exploiting its massive mineral resources for Africa's own benefit? Or is it a latter day version of 18th century adventurism, ruthless privateers with murder in their blood, ripping off a continent's wealth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The origins of Executive Outcomes are shrouded in some mystery, not surprising when one considers the circumstances of its creation and those involved. A &quot;UK Eyes Alpha&quot; (&quot;top secret&quot;) British intelligence report records that &quot;Executive Outcomes was registered in the UK on September 1993 by Anthony (Tony) Buckingham, a British businessman and Simon Mann, a former British officer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buckingham has been at pains to deny any &quot;corporate link&quot;. A veteran of the Special Air Service (SAS), a close friend and business associate of former Liberal Party leader Sir David Steel, Buckingham is chief executive of the oil firm, Heritage Oil and Gas, which has drilling interests in Angola and elsewhere. Heritage - originally British, now incorporated in the Bahamas - was also linked with Ranger Oil, a Canadian corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mann, a former troop commander in 22 SAS regiment specialising in intelligence, has served in a dozen countries, from Cyprus to Central America, Saudi Arabia to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in 1993 that Buckingham and Mann first met Eeben Barlow, a veteran of the Angolan war and former officer in the South African Defence Force (SADF). Barlow's last job in the SADF was in the Civil Co- operation Bureau (CCB) in foreign operations. He claims he ran Region 6, Western Europe. Among his tasks was leaking damaging information to friendly European journalists falsely linking the African National Congress with the Irish Republican Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1993, Buckingham and Mann commissioned Barlow to recruit a force of South African veterans with combat experience in Angola to capture Soyo, one of the centres of the oil industry, which was in the hands of Unita. A small force of less than 100 men succeeded, though Unita recaptured Soyo when the South Africans left. Luanda then put out a request for a larger mercenary force, offering oil concessions in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the British intelligence document, &quot;Ranger allocated $30- million for the operation and placed the contract with Buckingham and Mann.&quot; They in turn appointed Barlow and Lafras Luitingh - a former CCB colleague of Barlow who had led the first attack on Soyo - as commanders- in-chief of the mercenary force. The two recruited 500 men, most of them from the old South African Defence Force. And effectively turned the course of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Angola, they moved on to Sierra Leone, shoring up the regime of Valentine Strasser against the Revolutionary United Front of Foday Sankoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now reported to be in Kenya, where they have gone into partnership with Raymond Moi, a son of President Daniel arap Moi. They are said to have provided personnel to protect Canadian oil interests in the Sudan. They are believed to be providing protection for gold and oil prospecting operations in Uganda and are rumoured to have a training contract with the government.  They have been accused of supplying arms to Burundi. It has been reported that Executive Outcomes has links with more than 30 countries, most of them in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa has long experience with mercenary armies, but Executive Outcomes' soldiers are not just &quot;guns for hire&quot;. They are the advance guard for major business interests in a latter-day scramble for the mineral wealth of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the second floor of Plaza 107, a modern building at 535 King's Road, London, a single receptionist handles incoming calls to more than 18 companies. There are no name-plates, but from the plush offices that branch off from a long corridor - access to which is closely monitored by closed- circuit cameras - Buckingham, Mann and others run businesses which include international oil, gold and diamond mining ventures, a chartered accountancy practice, an airline, foreign security services and off-shore financial management services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A list of company and staff names, dated September 1994, includes Executive Outcomes Limited, Ibis Air International, Heritage Oil &amp; Gas, Branch International Limited, Branch Mining Limited and Capricorn Systems Limited.  Among the directors and staff are Buckingham, Mann, Sir David Steel, and the South African director of Ibis Air, Crause Steyl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch International is believed to be the holding corporation for a string of subsidiaries engaged in the hunt for oil, gold, diamonds and other precious minerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capricorn Systems is believed to be a descendent of the &quot;Capricorn Africa Society&quot;, established by the eccentric military hero who founded the SAS, Sir David Stirling - himself involved in mercenary operations before his death in 1990 at 74.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Outcomes flew into Angola in 1993 on two Beechcraft King Airs operating from Lanseria, courtesy of Capricorn Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later registered as Ibis Air in both Angola and South Africa, it is Executive Outcomes' air force, with a fleet that includes three Boeing 727s, at least two MI-17 helicopters, two &quot;Hind&quot; MI-24 gunships, several small fixed-wings - one of which has surveillance capabilities - at least two fighter jets and several private jets. For the last two years, Ibis has been operating from the Johannesburg International Airport, from the quarters of Simera, the aviation division of Denel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaza 107 has its twin in Strategic Resources Corporation, based in Lynnwood, Pretoria. Bank documents dated March 1995 showed this to be the holding corporation for another string of companies including Saracen, a security company specialising in &quot;VIP protection, strategic point protection and business security protection&quot;; Falconer Systems, set up as a front for Executive Outcomes in providing logistical supplies to &quot;United Nations- related organisations&quot;; and Bridge International, specialising in construction and civil engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How far Executive Outcomes has spread its wings is spelled out in the British Intelligence document: &quot;The indications are that Executive Outcomes is acquiring a wide reputation in sub-Saharan Africa for reliability and efficiency. It has a particular appeal to smaller countries desperate for rapid assistance. UN operations are cumbersome and slow and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) has hitherto shown itself to be generally ineffective except as a talking shop. There is every likelihood that Executive Outcomes's services, which are already extending beyond the field of security into import/export and administration, will continue increasingly to be sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are even indications, according to the document, that the OAU could be &quot;forced to offer Executive Outcomes a contract for the management of peace- keeping continent- wide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its successes &quot;are a cause for concern. It appears that the company and its associates are able to barter their services for large shares of an employing nation's natural resources and commodities. On present showing Executive Outcomes will become ever richer and more potent, capable of exercising real power, even to the extent of keeping military regimes in being. If it continues to expand at the present rate, its influence in sub-Saharan Africa could become crucial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be stopped where it started, however, in South Africa. Early recruitment by Executive Outcomes appeared to be, if not facilitated, then tolerated by senior leaders of the ANC who - as the British intelligence report puts it - believed &quot;it would remove from South Africa a number of personnel who might have had a destabilising effect on the forthcoming multi- racial elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ANC government has had second thoughts about Executive Outcomes.  Last month the national conventional arms control committee announced it would ask Parliament to pass legislation to curtail the involvement of South Africans in mercenary activities. The strategy is to subject the sale of military, or intelligence services, including training, to the same licensing process as dealing in military hardware - even to the extent of requiring end- user certificates. The legislation would also apply to South African citizens operating extra- territorially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barlow makes light of the proposed legislation. &quot;I doubt very much whether Prof Kadar Asmal's legislation is aimed at us and we have no fears for that,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not going to help anyone that is not a legitimate government, or which poses a threat to South Africa, or that is involved in activities which are really frowned upon by the outside world ... We have had a major impact on Africa. We have brought peace to two countries which were almost totally destroyed by civil wars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barlow claims that his company is the target of a &quot;smear&quot; campaign by the South African military, and accuses his former comrades of jealousy at the success of his private army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asmal will not discuss Executive Outcomes specifically, but there is little doubt that his intention is to use licensing to control Executive Outcomes.  It is legitimate for one government to ask for the assistance of another government, Asmal argues, but there is no room for free enterprise. Asmal dismisses the argument that Executive Outcomes has brought a modicum of stability to Africa - playing a peace-keeping role lamentably neglected by the international community, including the South African government. &quot;There is no case to be made - even to stop genocide,&quot; he says bluntly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Asmal can assume the control he seeks is another matter. The new Constitution protects citizens' rights to sell their labour. Extra- territorial legislation is notoriously difficult to implement. And Executive Outcomes's personnel are likely to have little trouble juggling citizenship with the help of grateful client-states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major Western powers could squash Executive Outcomes, but it is difficult to see their motive. Africa, to the rest of the world, is a troubled continent, a plague on the conscience and a trap for the unwary - as Somalia taught the United States. The world needs its mineral wealth. But it is far safer for elected leaders of Western democracies to leave responsibility for murky dealings with Africa's despots to those enjoying the limited liability of the corporate world. And if in the process they have given birth to the world's first corporate army, so be it?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - THE legal profession is set to be subjected to a special investigation by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's head of research, Charles Villa-Vicencio, has confirmed it is planning to hold a special hearing into the legal system under apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing it would invite submissions from various bodies, such as the National Association of Democratic Lawyers (Nadel).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's plans follow Desmond Tutu's call last year for judges to come forward and testify at the commission. Several supreme court and Appellate Division judges currently on the Bench gave notorious pro-apartheid judgments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villa-Vicencio said if the plan went ahead, the truth body would assess the submissions and carry out its own research - the same formula applied for the special hearings into the health and media industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadel spokesman Krish Govender said he hoped the investigation would focus not only on the judiciary, but also on the behaviour of prosecutors, advocates and attorneys general. By way of example, he recalled one prosecutor who had a carboard panel on the wall in his office on which he used to chalk up, with a cut-out noose, the number of people he had sent to the gallows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, other attorneys, who asked to remain anonymous, questioned the tactic of singling out individual professions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - Attempts to limit the rights of alleged criminals to bail bring to mind apartheid- era detention without trial, argues our legal correspondent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS a liberation movement, and also as a political party competing in democratic elections, the African National Congress's rhetoric on freedom sounded sincere and was convincing. As a government, however, it is not finding the reality of freedom quite as easy as the polemics of liberation politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was manifested again recently in two ANC responses - one at central government level and one from MEC for Safety and Security Jessie Duarte in the Gauteng provincial government - to the growing public outrage and bitterness at the continuing intolerable levels of crime. Both disclosed plans to limit the rights of an accused person to bail.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Minister Dullah Omar's plan proposed to deny bail to persons accused of certain serious offences, and Duarte wants bail only to be available to an accused after one week, in order, she said, for the police to carry out investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both plans are thoroughly misguided, put forward either in ignorance of the provisions of the interim Constitution and decisions of the supreme court, or in contemptuous disregard of them; and they are both the product of political expedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All persons accused of a crime are, of course, innocent until proven guilty.  That has always been our law, and the interim Constitution entrenches the principle beyond any interference from the government; also, the Constitution's fundamental rights entitle every arrested person to bail except where the interests of justice require it to be refused. Our courts have recognised and given effect to these rights and principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 1995 application for bail brought by a Mr Mbele, the Johannesburg Supreme Court said the interim Constitution disabled the legislature from limiting the grant of bail in any circumstances: the grant or refusal of bail was the job of the courts alone, after considering all relevant circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case decided in the Free State Supreme Court last year, and recently reported, takes this principle rather further. There Judge JW Edeling thought that a prohibition on bail for persons charged with certain offences already contained in the Criminal Procedure Act was not constitutional. He also, quite correctly, held that the refusal of bail was a huge attack on the fundamental right of liberty of an unconvicted person and that it could only be authorised where the interests of justice required it and, again, this was a matter for the court to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two cases are a good indication of the attitude that our courts will take, and it is inconceivable that the Constitutional Court will ever countenance the Omar and Duarte initiatives: after all, they amount to detention without trial of innocent persons that are every bit as reprehensible as section 29 of the old apartheid Internal Security Act. It is nevertheless depressing that only three years into democracy, senior ANC ministers are already seduced by the easy answers that anti-democratic laws often provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the two ministers and their advisers must know that authoritarian inroads into the right to bail will have no impact at all in the war against crime. They will not improve the quality of detective work or the efficiency of the courts, or the competence of public prosecutors, or the capacity of the prisons; and they do not address, in any way, the socio- economic causes of crimes such as theft or robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, these doomed initiatives simply create the illusion of government action where there is, in truth, merely hopeless incompetence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - THE government's efforts to curtail the activities of Executive Outcomes (EO) - the South African company which appears to be running a booming business in the export of mercenaries and ancillary services - are understandable, but should perhaps be the subject of more public debate before legislation is passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a number of reasons why the profession of the mercenary should be discouraged, in addition to a general dislike of war. If war cannot be avoided it is surely desirable, for example, that the combatants fight on issues of principle which concern them personally. Otherwise they are nothing more than hired killers and as such they criminalise the cause in which they fight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an argument to be made that what has been described as the privatisation of war usurps government's prerogative where foreign policy is concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The character of EO itself further prejudices the case against mercenaries.  At least two of its senior executives have been identified as former members of the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB). The activities of the CCB during the apartheid era have still to be unravelled, but it has been widely described as a state assassination squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until such time as their members clear the record by making full dislosure, there is justification for fearing the worst: that they are akin to the likes of Eugene de Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such they would be better described as rabid dogs, rather than dogs of war, and (at least until they convince that they have been misunderstood) it is dangerous to unleash them on our neighbours in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all of that, we are not enthused by the course of action being pursued by government. The proposal is essentially to subject the sale of military services to the same controls as the sale of a piece of military hardware, such as an artillery shell. Dealers would need to be registered and deals licensed to the extent of end- user certificates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from practical considerations relating to jurisdiction, it needs to be pointed out that there is a considerable difference between a piece of military hardware and a South African citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, the latter has the advantage of various constitutional guarantees not enjoyed by artillery shells where freedom of movement is concerned, as well as rights to sell his or her labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know where Kadar Asmal is coming from. But we're not too sure where he is going.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - President Nelson Mandela is genuine in his desire to draw other parties into his Cabinet and we should accept at face value his statement that there is a great deal of talent in all parties which can contribute to government. But however benign his motivation, the effect will be malevolent: other parties will be co-opted as ANC partners, which will seriously impede the development of a normal parliamentary opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a firm offer is indeed made to the Democratic Party (DP) and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), it will present both of them with different, but equally acute, dilemmas. The PAC will be tempted by the short-term opportunistic advantages: gaining a prestige and recognition they have been so far unable to attain on their own. Mandela is throwing them a potential lifeline. But in the long term they need a separate policy and identity - built on the ability to highlight the faults and weaknesses of the ANC government - if they are ever to provide a serious alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some DP leaders would relish the opportunity to exert a direct influence on government, rather than carping from the sidelines. And the changes in ANC economic policy have narrowed the gap between them and the DP, making opposition harder and participation easier. But the DP has to decide whether its aim is to influence those in power, or to be part of the long- term development of a parliamentary opposition large enough to challenge the ANC.  Does the DP want to be part of a one- party democracy, or does it want to contribute to the emergence of a multiparty system?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA - ZAMBIAN President Frederick Chiluba has suspended a distinguished high court Judge, Kabazo Chanda, who has a history of criticising the president and the country's poor human rights record. Chiluba has refused to disclose reasons for the suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Article 98 Section 5 of the Constitution, the president is empowered to suspend a high court or supreme court judge whose performance or conduct he deems unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential spokesman Richard Sakala said Judge Chanda will have his conduct as a judge probed by a three-person tribunal. The tribunal will be composed of supreme court Judge Robert Kapembwa, who is also chairman of Zambia's Anti-Corruption Commission, and another supreme court judge, Brian Gardner. The third member of the tribunal is Judge Leonard Onyolo of Malawi's supreme court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tribunal, which will start investigations in two weeks' time, is expected to recommend whether Judge Chanda should be relieved of his duties permanently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reliable sources in the judiciary say the suspension may have something to do with the petitions pending in the supreme court which have been filed by opposition groups challenging Zambia's recent elections and Chiluba's legitimacy as president. The petitions were filed last week by former president Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party and the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF), but the court has postponed hearing them until later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba, the groups say, has a Zairean father, which would preclude him from being president according to a constitutional amendment which he personally oversaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Magistrates' and Judges' Association of Zambia has denounced Judge Chanda's suspension, calling it intimidation by Chiluba. Timothy Katanekwa, the association's chairman, said the suspension has sent shivers down the spines of several judges in the high and supreme courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katanekwa, who is a high court commissioner, said: &quot;Judges are not above the law, but the use of a tribunal, if not properly done, might be a tool which can undermine the independence of the judiciary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the practice of meting out discipline to judges, through a tribunal, is a rare practice in Commonwealth countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition parties have similarly criticised Judge Chanda's suspension, saying it undermined the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dean Mung'omba, president of the opposition Zambia Democratic Contress (ZDC) , said: &quot;This cannot be in the interest of justice. The aim is to control the judiciary so that they (Chiluba's party, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy) can be stealing cases in the same way they stole the vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LPF chairman Dr Rodger Chongwe similarly said the suspension was a blow to the independence of the judiciary. He said the suspension was a signal that Chiluba and his ruling party would not stand judges who frustrate their interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The action was political. It has nothing to do with his performance. It's a warning to other judges. If they don't toe the line of Chiluba's politics, they will suffer the same fate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Chanda drew considerable attention to himself in the middle of last year when he overruled the speaker of the Zambian Parliament, Dr Robinson Nabulyato, who had sentenced Fred M'membe, the editor of The Post newspaper, and his assistant, Bright Mwape, to indefinite prison terms for contempt of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Chanda argued that the speaker and Parliament had no right to imprison people. The Post has persistently exposed corruption in Chiluba's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely three weeks ago, Judge chanda sparked a separate controversy by releasing 53 suspects who were awaiting trial, because of failure by prosecutors to bring them to court speedily, arguing that justice delayed was justice denied. Some of the released suspects had been awaiting trial since as far back as 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Chanda, so far, has not said anything about the suspension, except that he would speak when the right time came.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KIGALI - THE Zairean government this week finally ordered its much- threatened counter- offensive against Rwandan-backed rebels who have seized swathes of territory in the east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite claiming it has Libyan support, there is little evidence that Zaire's battered and ill-disciplined army is any more able to carry out the directive from the Prime Minister, Kengo wa Dondo, than it was to resist the original rebel onslaught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have ordered our armed forces to conduct the war and recover regions currently under occupation and restore the authority of the state,&quot; Kengo said on state television.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister called on the Zairean people to be &quot;in communion&quot; with the army they so often fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has been threatening a counter-offensive for weeks. It is expected to come from Kisangani, the northern city under threat from the rebels. The army claims to have already launched small-scale raids, although the military has not claimed any success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Soviet-built helicopter gunships, manned by white men, have arrived in Kisangani. Radio Zaire early this week claimed Tripoli has offered assistance for the offensive, without saying what kind, during a visit by the Libyan foreign minister. Foreign mercenaries are reported to be gathering in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army chief of staff, General Mahele Leiko Bokungo, appointed last month with draconian powers, is in Kisangani to oversee the counter-offensive. The regional Governor, Lombeya Bosongo, told Reuters he expected it to be a swift campaign. &quot;It won't be long before this adventure is over,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are few signs that the army is better able or more willing to fight than when government forces fled in terror - stopping only to loot and rape - in the face of the rebel offensive launched last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discipline remains a serious problem which has undermined public support for the army. Earlier this month the government declared parts of the country a disaster area, not because of the rebel attacks but because its own military was responsible for widespread destruction and attacks on civilians.  Military tribunals have begun to try offenders, including six senior officers, for desertion, rape, looting and selling weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire has been recruiting heavily in expectation of the counter-offensive. It can also count on the continued support of the Rwandan army which invaded eastern Zaire in October to rout Hutu extremists and send home hundreds of thousands of refugees camped on its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda is unlikely to want to see the buffer zone it has carved out reoccupied by a hostile Zairean army. While a well- organised counter- offensive may block further advances by the rebels, or push them back, it will be another matter for government forces to retake all the lost territory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WINDHOEK - THERE is growing speculation in Namibia that President Sam Nujoma will not stand down as president in 1999 as demanded by the country's Constitution, but run for a third term in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for Nujoma to run for another term is believed to strong within the ruling party, the South West African People's Organisation (Swapo).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma is 67 and would be 70 when due to give up office, younger than other regional leaders such as Mandela (78) and Mugabe (72).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma himself has given conflicting signals about his intentions. He told the BBC World Service last year that he would stand down to make way for a younger member of Swapo, but within weeks he was telling Zimbabwean television that the question of whether he would run again would be left for the party to decide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless Nujoma clearly indicates that he will stand down, he is likely to face calls from within Swapo to stay on as the &quot;father of the nation&quot;. Nujoma has been Namibia's only president since the country's independence in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any attempt to run for office again would mean changing the Constitution, which currently restricts the incumbent to two five-year terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo has the political power to amend the Constitution with its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, but the suggestion that the country's supreme law be changed to suit a third term for Nujoma is already meeting resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia's Constitution has not been amended since independence. Professor AndrG du Pisani, a political scientist at the University of Namibia, said of the prospect of changing the country's supreme law: &quot;The Constitution is the founding document of the new republic. To tamper with it would be hugely undesirable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Pisani added that a constitutional amendment would result in &quot;personal rule&quot; by Nujoma. &quot;It effectively means the incumbent is the only person fit to hold high office. The person and the office become almost one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of The Namibian newspaper, Gwen Lister, was unequivocal on the question of a third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president should leave office with his reputation and integrity intact, and not go the way of Kaunda and other African leaders, who have been discredited by serving virtual life terms in office,&quot; Lister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Swapo members privately say that a third term for Nujoma may not be desirable but could avoid damaging in-fighting within Swapo over succession to the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma has not groomed an heir-apparent to his office. Prime Minister Hage Geingob is admired internationally, but has little popular support within Swapo. Minister of Trade Hidipo Hamutenya is believed to nurse presidential ambitions, but has so far been content to wait in the wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Agriculture Helmut Angula had any presidential hopes he might harbour dented when he was summarily moved by Nujoma last year from the finance portfolio after only a short time in the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Lands Pendukeni Ithana is sometimes mentioned as a rising star in the party, but her fortunes largely depend on whether she is able to steer through sensitive land reform legislation effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Fisheries Hifikepunye Pohamba is regarded as a possible successor if the party decides to go for another &quot;father figure&quot;. Recent speculation has focused on a combined ticket of Swapo vice-president and Deputy Prime Minister Hendrik Witbooi as the party's presidential candidate for the 1999 election with Hamutenya as his prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo's official position is that no decision about changing the Constitution to accommodate a third term for Nujoma has yet been taken. The issue is almost certain to come up at the party's congress scheduled for the middle of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another option apparently already discussed at high levels within the party is to put the issue of a third term for Nujoma to a national referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome of this, if a &quot;yes&quot; for Nujoma, could be used to offset international fears that democracy in Namibia was being eroded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - GOLD smuggling suspect Paul Ekon, once close to top African National Congress leaders, has written to ANC national chair Jacob Zuma asking for the contents of a report in which the organisation's intelligence wing allegedly warned leaders to steer clear of Ekon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dated January 13 and leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian soon after, the letter confirms links Ekon had with ANC leaders before and after the elections in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, Safety and Security Minister Syney Mufamadi confirmed in Parliament that Ekon, who lives in London, was under police scrutiny for his alleged involvement in a consignment of R4,8-million in unwrought gold, seized at Johannesburg International Airport in June 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter, Ekon says: &quot;I found that when the ANC first moved into Shell House (its headquarters) they were highly disorganised and were in need of many, many services. I tried my best! ... I have never nor will I ever ask for anything. I was very worried about the security of a lot of the members of the ANC and hence offered them guns. I also helped with flights, arranged phones, assisted with fund-raising and tried to assist in whatever else they needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Ekon says: &quot;I feel as if I have been betrayed by the people I tried to help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G reported last September on Ekon's R500 000 defamation suit - later withdrawn - against former ANC political prisoner Peter-Paul Ngwenya. In court papers Ekon claimed Ngwenya had told Swedish investors in an ANC- supported &quot;black-empowerment&quot; television consortium that Ekon &quot;is a drug dealer; worked with (former security police chief) Basie Smit with a hit squad; and was associated with the Robert Smit murders&quot;. The deal in which Ngwenya, Ekon and Dali Tambo, among others, were partners, never got off the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G learnt at the time that information given to the Swedish investors had allegedly originated with a background check the ANC Department of Intelligence and Security had done on Ekon, and that the result of this check had been a warning to ANC leaders to stay &quot;at an arm's length from Ekon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter Ekon asks Zuma, who is the ANC's former intelligence head: &quot; Jacob, please can you let me know if in fact a secret report was done and the contents thereof as (these) drugs/hit squad allegations have really affected me and I am desperate to clear my name. I am not perturbed about the other allegations that the press are making as I believe those will be cleared by the ongoing police investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - IN another salvo fired at the African National Congress'sleadership, the branch members in the Free State town of Bothaville this week condemned national leaders' &quot;arrogance&quot; and nominated former premier Terror Lekota for the position of provincial chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's Bloemfontein branch had also nominated Lekota for the position last week. However, ANC Acting General Secretary Cheryl Carolus announced on Monday he would decline the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bothaville branch nominates Lekota despite the statement of Cheryl Carolus that he will not contest the election. The arrogance, undemocratic and unconstitutional manner in which the top leadership has addressed the problem in the province makes a mockery of the ANC Constitution,&quot; said Bothaville ANC general secretary Aupa Ramaisa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike the premier imposed on the Free State (Ivy Matsepe-Cassaburi), the provincial chairman will ultimately be elected by branches at the conference.  The branches will be voting, not Carolus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolus had, however, said Lekota had informed the ANC national executive's lekgotla last Sunday that he had after &quot;long thought and consultation&quot; decided not to make himself available for the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said two other nominees for the position, former Free State chair Pat Matosa and former MEC for economic affairs Ace Magashule - whom the ANC redeployed to the National Assembly - would also not stand for election to the top five positions but would be eligible for election as ordinary members of the provincial executive committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolus said this was a &quot;gesture on their side&quot; to try to ensure the province could start after its provincial conference without the tensions which superceded it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota was sworn in as a member of the Senate this week in a move which is certain to see him elected as chairman of the National Council of Provinces, which is to replace the Senate next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to discuss his nomination as ANC Free State chair, saying &quot;I would rather not deal with party matters at this stage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Free State provincial conference takes place from February 14 to 16 under the guidance of a task-group mandated by the ANC national executive committee (NEC) to restore political equilibrium to the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Task-group leader, Minister of Labour Tito Mboweni, said no disciplinary measures would be taken against the Bloemfontein branch, and that members acted out of ignorance when they nominated Lekota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's Constitution dealt with grievance procedures to be followed by branches, Mboweni said. &quot;In this case, they forgot the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But angry Bloemfontein ANC members say their national leaders themselves have ignored the party's Constitution by denying them the right to nominate Lekota as their chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have observed with utter disappointment and shock the growing tendency by the present ANC leadership at national level to dish out posts and positions undemocratically to favourites instead of following the democratic election route,&quot; said Bloemfontein ANC member Jones Bopape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 5.1 of the ANC constitution as adopted at the 1994 conference in Bloemfontein defines the rights of members and says among other things: 'a member of the ANC shall have the right to take part in elections and be elected or appointed to any committee, structure, commission or delegation of the ANC'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The undemocratic action of the NEC in the Free State has created the impression that it has become a law unto itself to the point where it is the major violator of the Constitution instead of upholding it ardently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota's supporters have also attacked their leaders for remaining mum on the auditor general's report into alleged corruption in the province. The report, released in December, found there had been unauthorised spending of R7,7-million in the provincial Department of Economic Affairs and Tourism while Magashule was in charge of its affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The contents of this report clearly documents substantial disregard for due process and proper procedure by individuals in positions of public trust,&quot; Acting Auditor General JAJ Loots concluded. &quot;It is clear that the interests of the taxpayer and that of good government have not been served in this instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bothaville ANC members are aghast that Magashule would be available for election to the provincial executive committee before the implications of the auditor general's report are considered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - FOLLOWING bomb blasts at two homes of people linked to People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) in Cape Town this week, observers warned the organisation was creating an environment in which gangs could flourish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad could end up promoting what it is trying to destroy, warned Don Pinnock, a former University of Cape Town criminologist who has published extensively on gangsterism in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The organisation is consolidating gangs in the Western Cape, and is in effect creating alliances among gangsters that would never otherwise have existed,&quot; he said. &quot;This leads to better-organised gangs and consequently to more crime, which is what Pagad set out to fight in the first place.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was responding to fears expressed in the city that the exchange of fire between Pagad and gangs on the Cape Flats recently could lead to a full-scale war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim Judicial Council warned: &quot;If any child or person is going to be harmed in any way by the drug merchants or their allies, unprecedented anger will be generated in the Muslim community which will be very difficult to control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pregnant woman died and five people were wounded last Sunday in attacks on members of the Muslim community. Two of the attacks were aimed at members of the Gatesville Mosque, where Pagad holds regular meetings. Pagad was blamed for five retaliatory attacks on the homes of alleged drug dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ganief Hendricks, representative of the Islamic Unity Convention, which has strong ties with Pagad, said: &quot;The chances are very strong that the latest spate of violence could indicate the start of an open war. It must be remembered violence is not part of Islam, but life is sacred and therefore Pagad will have to protect its people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that elements within Pagad hoped to take over the Western Cape government eventually, and would use force to achieve this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinnock said Pagad is &quot;essentially a political organisation aiming to contest the next elections in 1999. It is forming political alliances, most notably with the Pan Africanist Congress and with Justice Minister Dullah Omar, and could one day become a political force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the moment, however, it is a vigilante group causing a lot of damage to the community it is trying to serve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinnock said gangs on the Cape Flats are still seen by many as &quot;Robin Hood figures who are there to protect the community. It is wrong to assume gangs are seen as the bad guys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only real solution to the problem of gangsterism in the Western Cape is to raise the general standard of living, which Pagad will not achieve.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - IT is hard to imagine Major-General Refiloe Phelile Florence Sedibe (aka Jackie Sedibe and wife of Defence Minister Joe Modise) barking orders to stiff young soldiers. The country's highest-ranking woman in the military is a shy, softly spoken, grey- haired matron, who looks like she should be at home baking cookies with her grandchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Sedibe is about to embark on a new phase of her army career as chief director of equal opportunities in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). It is a job which she insists, in response to criticism from opposition politicians, was gained on merit &quot;because I do my job very well, and not because of who I am&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But being the wife of a senior Cabinet minister and counting both President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as dining companions can do a lot to boost a girl's status. Still, let us not talk of gravy train.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what is meant by that expression,&quot; she says with genuine amusement. &quot;If there is a gravy train, I've certainly never got on it.&quot; When they returned from exile, she and Modise were both employed by the African National Congress, while other former Um-khonto weSizwe (MK) soldiers struggled to earn a living. Now they're both earning huge government salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've always lived an independent life. I won't give up my career just to appease public opinion. It's like asking why Winnie Mandela didn't just settle down to be the president's wife. Because she has her own public persona and did not want to lose it. Anyway, I've been a professional for 30 years without pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is her second day in the new job and she is wearing a visitor's identity badge on her lapel. &quot;Oh, this,&quot; she said when I pointed it out. &quot;I'm getting my own later this evening, but I'm still trying to find my way from the reception to my office. I don't even know what my phone number is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sedibe is in the process of moving from central Pretoria to her new home in the shiny glass structure on the outskirts - known affectionately as Battlestar Galactica - which the SANDF shares with Armscor and the minister of defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her office, with empty picture hooks on the walls and devoid of all personal effects - &quot;I'm still waiting for the boxes to be delivered&quot; - is three floors and one wing away from Modise's. But she says their schedules prevent cosy rides together to and from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sedibe was not keen to do this interview, and her nervousness showed. Many of my questions were either sidestepped by rhetoric or blocked by a tired &quot; you are asking me all these questions about things in the past. I want to move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the past has a remarkable way of popping up when you least want it. At the same time that the general was reluctantly sharing tales of her military exploits against &quot;an oppressive and inhumane&quot; apartheid regime, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was hearing allegations that a man identified as her brother, Glory Sedibe (once a senior MK soldier), had been a spy for the same regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was not a blood brother. They have got it wrong and are trying to pull my husband's name into it,&quot; she later explained. &quot;He was a cousin, and anyway I did not know him very well, but we all knew that he had been turned into an askari. It's sad, but nothing for us to be ashamed of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glory Sedibe was abducted from a Swaziland jail by Vlakplaas operatives in 1986 and forced to betray his MK comrades, some of whom were killed while crossing the border from Swaziland to South Africa. She could easily have been a victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first women to join MK, as an idealistic 17 year old in 1964, Sedibe was active as a signals operator specialising in clandestine radio communications. Her responsibility included linking MK operatives in the frontline states and South Africa. &quot;I did not take part in actual combat, but was never far from it,often not realising the dangers until having crossed over borders. But really, I don't want to rehash the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born 52 years ago at White River in Mpumalanga, Sedibe's mother was a domestic worker and her father (whose surname was Mdluli) worked in Johannesburg. &quot;But that is a private matter. I don't want to talk about.&quot; They parted when she was about six years old and she went to live with a maternal uncle, Ben Sedibe, in Barberton. An ANC activist, and &quot;the man who made me what I am today,&quot; he became her role model. She took his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not long before she was politically involved. &quot;At eight I was distributing ANC leaflets or carrying messages.&quot; Soon after her 17th birthday it was decided the time had come for her to become a fully-fledged guerrilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She joined MK and was sent to the then Soviet Union for training at the Odessa Infantry Academy, where her aptitude for signals led to her being fast- tracked for advanced training in Moscow. She was one of three women chosen.  The Soviet Union was like a fairyland after the oppression of South Africa. &quot; I had a great time. The people were friendly and supportive of our cause.&quot; But again she was scant on detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stint in Tanzania followed the year-long training programme, one of her first jobs being the Wankie Operation against Rhodesia in 1967/68. It is 45 minutes into the interview and she wants to leave for another appointment. I beg for more time. She offers another half-hour, but clams up almost immediately when asked about how she met Modise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, really I can't remember.&quot; It is a touchy subject. &quot;We worked together and became friendly, but I can't remember where or when.&quot; When pressed, she admits theirs is a traditional marriage. &quot;We asked for permission to live together and he paid lobola, but please don't mention that, I really would prefer to keep my personal life private.&quot; The couple became parents late in life and have two daughters: Boipuso and Lesedi (aged 11 and 9).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the same reason she refuses to talk about her relationship with her biological father, whom she met once as an adult while living in Swaziland. &quot; He was passing through on his way to Switzerland, where he had lived for many years, and we were introduced. It's a very painful subject, and that's all I want to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sedibe was among the first group of former MK members to be integrated into the military in 1994, and has served in the office of the inspector general, concentrating primarily on the interests of women in the SANDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again she was fast-tracked and zoomed up the ranks, but really that has nothing to do with her husband. &quot;I feel very proud to be the first black woman general,&quot; she says, &quot;in the sense that we are beginning to be taken as people who can produce and are capable of bringing about change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about the racial tension among the different forces, she slips into &quot;Mrs Modise&quot; and begins to spout the party line. &quot;It is difficult to change prejudices overnight. But I was involved in the integration process and on the whole things have gone quite well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says her role is to make sure transition continues smoothly. &quot;Our aim is a smaller, efficient and integrated SANDF, to ensure our sovereignty.&quot; It sounded like pillow-talk to me, but there was no time for more questions as my 75 minutes were up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - GIANT wine co-operative KWV's bid to be converted into a company is becoming increasingly controversial as industry stakeholders accuse it of trying to hang on to more than R1,6-billion worth of assets, accumulated during apartheid years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV's members - 4 751 wine farmers - form an exclusive white club with an enormous stake in the country's wine industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several influential people in the industry, including wine farmers and journalists, this week condemned KWV's plans, saying it goes against the spirit of reconciliation and development in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a dozen people interviewed by the Mail &amp; Guardian preferred to remain anonymous, saying the issue was extremely sensitive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wine consultant Michael Fridjhon, who is indirectly involved in talks between the government and KWV, said the co-operative's plans could have a huge impact on the future of the wine industry in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One wine journalist said if KWV's attempts succeed it would ensure that &quot; past white privilege would be turned into present assets&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 80% of KWV's 4 751 members voted on December 6 last year to convert from its present co-operative status to a company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that the co-operative will function as a company from April this year, its assets being put directly into the hands of the wine farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV has, however, been locked in a legal dispute over the issue since December 12. Six days after the vote to convert, Minister of Land Affairs and Agriculture Derek Hanekom obtained a delay from the supreme court in its ratification of the scheme in terms of which the transformation is arranged.  The dispute is due to be decided on March 25, if it is not settled out of court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts in the industry have been up in arms about the co-operative's attempts to privatise its assets, built up in the apartheid years through special tax breaks granted to KWV as a statutory body in terms of the Wine and Spirit Control Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A task team was set up by Hanekom in December seeking clarity on the legality of KWV's decision to privatise its regulatory function. A representative for Hanekom, Herman Rademeyer, said the minister was not in principle against KWV's plans. However, he must ensure that the development of the wine industry is not hampered by KWV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spier Wine Estate's &quot;official ambassador&quot;, Jabulane Ntshangase, was the only person willing to openly criticise KWV. Ntshangase, who contributes to various wine publications and is a member of South African Airways's wine selection panel, told the M&amp;G: &quot;I can categorically state that KWV has done absolutely nothing for the development of the wine industry in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Ntshangase: &quot;It is actually totally unbelievable that there is only one qualified black wine-maker in the whole of South Africa.&quot; She is Carmen Stevens, who qualified in 1996 from the University of Stellenbosch and is currently employed by Stellenbosch Farmers Winery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As from this year, Ntshangase and well- known wine author John Platter will be running a wine development programme. Each year, four of 10 students admitted to the Elsenburg Agricultural College at the University of Stellenbosch must come from a previously disadvantaged community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Ntshangase: &quot;We aim to be aggressive in implementing affirmative action in the wine industry. It would, however, be a great pity if KWV succeeds in its plans to maintain the status quo of white privilege in the industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV's group director of public relations and human resources, Theo Pegel, told the M&amp;G he saw very little wrong with the racial imbalance in the wine industry. &quot;It is a simple fact of life that in almost all of the wine- producing countries of the world the wine-makers are almost exclusively white.  I think that KWV in the past did plenty to initiate development programmes and that our future programmes will ensure that the industry develops sufficiently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that &quot;People must realise that the profile of a co-operative is not very high internationally&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a statement released this week by the Department of Land Affairs and Agriculture Director General, Frans van der Merwe, the dispute was discussed by KWV, Hanekom and the department at a January 10 meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There it was resolved that the minister would appoint a committee to investigate the regulation of the wine and distilling industries. It was also agreed that all parties would co-operate in an audit of the assets controlled by KWV.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - ONE of the country's top funding organisations for students has been hit by allegations of mismanagement, with its chief accused of lending donors' cash to her closest friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Educational Opportunities Council, which channels about R6-million a year - most from USAid - to students, has already called in independent auditors to investigate its accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its board of trustees, which includes Truth and Reconciliation Commission chair Desmond Tutu and top businessman Nthato Motlana, has also been summoned to an emergency meeting to investigate allegations laid by disgruntled middle managers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations centre on R180 000 the non- governmental organisation (NGO) transferred late last year from a bank account established for donations from United States group Kellogg into a separate administration account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cash was spent on a new car due to executive director Eleanor Molefe and a near R68 000 loan to her friend and the council's personnel manager, Puleng Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board of trustees chairman Hazel Moolman said on Thursday preliminary investigations last weekend by auditor Ernst &amp; Young suggested the switch in funds between accounts was above board, and done at the suggestion of its banker, First National Bank. Sources in the NGO's finance department deny this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Moolman added Molefe had circumvented internal procedures to give Zulu the loan, and had failed to seek permission from the trustees. The NGO has a floating housing loan account of R50 000, and offers short term loans to employees for emergency expenditure such as hospital bills. Zulu spent the money on a new car. Moolman said Zulu was repaying the loan, and paying interest on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moolman said she remained confident of Molefe's integrity - she has been with the organisation for several years, and took over as executive director in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the board of trustees would be questioning her over the loan, and other staff allegations against her management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Molefe will be chastised,&quot; Moolman said. &quot;To say there is a clique within the council is going a bit far. But obviously staff have grievances and we have to look at that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molefe declined to comment, saying board members had instructed her on Wednesday to stay silent pending further inquiries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several staff members, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Mail &amp; Guardian there were serious concerns about the NGO's high turnover of staff, recruitment practices and financial controls. It has been without a finance manager since the departure of Kenneth Ndeve in November, just before the R180 000 was transferred. Moolman says the NGO is still searching for a suitable replacement, and that management consultants are standing in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGO, established in 1977, has provided bursaries for thousands of students for study in South Africa and overseas. Moolman says there have never been questions raised previously about its financial controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the timing of the row is poor. Plans to increase tertiary education opportunities are being hampered by lower government subsidies to the sector, which is prompting institutions to slash funding to poorer students.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - FOUR people have emerged as frontrunners for South Africa's top soccer job following the resignation of soccer supremo Solomon &quot;Stix&quot; Morewa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent members of the South African soccer fraternity this week named former South African National Football Association (Sanfa) chief George Thabe, former South African Soccer Association (Sasa) vice- president Thembi Mtokwane, the Premier Soccer League's chief executive officer Trevor Phillips and South African Football Association (Safa) vice-president Molefi Olifant as desirable candidates for the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four would not comment this week on their possible candidature.  Speculation on who would lead South African football has been rife since the Pickard report said Morewa was both greedy and untrustworthy and wanted to use soccer to enrich himself.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer officials said the association should be run by someone with the necessary qualifications and experience of local football to enable the sport to overcome the trouble which has muddied it recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Football experts contacted by the Mail &amp; Guardian differed in their opinions of what the role of the new president should be. Some suggested that perhaps two people should preside over the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pickard report said Safa's new president should not receive any special &quot;perks&quot; from the job. &quot;He must be willing to do the job for the mere love of the game and be so financially independent that he cannot be coerced into any decision by offers of benefits to himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also recommended a full-time executive be appointed to run the daily affairs of the association. This position, according to Pickard, &quot;should be of no significance in order to avoid him aspiring to popularity in the public eye&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safa's executive committee emphasised that the new president must be South African and not a foreigner. Executive member and treasurer, Vincent Baartjies, said that the idea of a figurehead president was unnecessary as he would act only &quot;as a puppet&quot;. &quot;The person must know the finer details of local football,&quot; urged Baartjies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the new administrative head should have an understanding of all football- related matters &quot;from what happens at the tiny amateur club in Garankuwa to the big clubs in the Premier Soccer League&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baartjies said the person must have grown with the organisation and must have been &quot;on the outside&quot; of problems experienced in soccer administration the past six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baartjies said none of the candidates mentioned by the media would make a worthy candidate for the top post at Safa because they lacked the hands-on experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that the new president must be appointed from within the South African soccer community. &quot;I think it is important that we make this point clear that the person must come from within South African soccer circles.  Kevin Keegan can't come here and run our soccer because he knows nothing about South African football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safa's Olifant told M&amp;G the new boss should be a young person with a sound financial background and said he believed he had the right credentials to replace Morewa. He claimed to have support from prominent football officials.  He said there must be a move away from the executive president to an honourary president not employed by Safa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation's second vice-president, Danny Jordaan, said the reason for past problems was that &quot;too much power was in the hands of one person&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to reconstruct football, thereby providing a democratic structure, which will provide for correct football administration,&quot; said Jordaan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would be foolish to hire somebody from overseas because the person may not have sufficient local knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obakeng Molatedi, also an executive member of the association, said a well- educated, career-oriented person from within soccer circles should be appointed as football's new head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said another executive member, Reuben Mahlalela: &quot;The person must establish strong relations with Fifa (Federation Internationale des Football Associations) who are presently very concerned about our administration because of the (Pickard) commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Maguire, editor of local football magazine Kickoff, believed the new administrative head of soccer should be honest and have charisma. &quot;He should be a dignified guy with a good track record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maguire believed two people should be employed to oversee the administration of local soccer. &quot;One should perform a figurehead role while the other could be involved in a more administrative capacity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maguire said Trevor Phillips, the chief executive officer of the Premier Soccer League, had the necessary experience and qualifications for the administrative position.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - Squatters at Cape Town's Waterfront could go to the Constitutional Court to fight their eviction, reports Gustav Thiel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEARLY 300 squatters living next to a proposed new entrance to the upmarket Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town could force the Constitutional Court to assess the constitutionality of the Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Matthew Chaskalson, a constitutional expert at the Centre for Applied Legal Studies in Johannesburg, a provision in the Constitution clearly states that the decision to evict should lie in the hands of the courts - yet, countrywide, evictions are being carried out by city councils on their own initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squatters, living at the site opposite Port Road and next to the well- known Arena nightclub, say they have been there for more than ten years on average and are eager to stay. The Cape Town City Council tried to evict them on three different occasions last year, but withdrew each time when lawyers for the squatters threatened court action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Kahanowitz of the Legal Resources Centre in the city said that the city council backed down before Section 3b of the Act could be tested in court. The section says that squatters may be removed by city councils without the consent of the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We firmly believe that the section of the Act will eventually be removed from the statutes because it is clearly unconstitutional,&quot; Kahanowitz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also clear that city councils in the Western Cape are aware of this fact because they are apparently not willing for the Act to be challenged in court.&quot; The councils had withdrawn on all seven occasions when they were taken to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems to me that the city councils try to get away with evictions when they are not challenged in courts, but back down the minute the opposite happens,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cape Town City Council legal representative, Fiona Ogle, said Section 3b was &quot;probably&quot; against the spirit of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she denied that city councils in the Western Cape tried to avoid testing the issue in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists for the homeless say squatters' rights could be dramatically improved once a test case has made it into the Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kahanowitz did, however, agree that the Port Road squatters are living in a particularly sensitive area of Cape Town, where thousands of local and foreign tourists will enter the waterfront tourist mecca if the proposed new entrance is approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager of the Arena nightclub, Robert Barry, said the presence of the squatters causes &quot;great damage to the image of Cape Town as a prime tourist destination&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;We have complained to the police and the Cape Town City Council on numerous occasions about the squatters and promises have been made that they will be removed. We frequently experience violent behaviour by the squatters which must be detrimental to our business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomsa Ndlumbini, who runs a shop in the squatter community, said: &quot;Some people have been living here for more than 20 years and have nowhere else to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - DEFENCE Secretary Pierre Steyn came under intense pressure from the defence establishment after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's public release of details from the &quot;third force&quot; report which Steyn made in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the truth commission bombshell last week, vultures gathered to pick De Klerk's political bones - how else could it be when the commission's deputy chair, Alex Boraine, accused De Klerk of entrusting action on Steyn's report to three generals who had been implicated themselves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this week a National Party official remarked that the saga had turned out &quot;quite well for us&quot;. De Klerk and the NP had a flurry of denials and counter denials - including statements by Steyn appearing to contradict the commission's - to thank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some speculate that Steyn's statements - in which he claimed his report had not contained allegations against current South African National Defence Force chief George Meiring and two former generals - could have come due to pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Defence Secretariat official this week confirmed there had been &quot;a lot of unpleasantness in the department ... Everyone in the department thought he (Steyn) was against the chief of the defence force&quot;. But the official claimed it was &quot;not true at all&quot; that Steyn had anything against Meiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyn, as civilian counterpart to Meiring, is theoretically the SANDF chief's equal. But as head of the relatively recently established Defence Secretariat, Steyn will find it hard to perform his duties without the co- operation of Meiring and the senior officer corps of the SANDF, still dominated by personnel from the old dispensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another official said Steyn had been treated &quot;like an outcast&quot; in the military establishment after the truth commission release. While he said Steyn had been right to point out that the evidence contained in his report had been based on untested intelligence, he felt Steyn had overreacted and denied too much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, Boraine released a statement saying the commission stood by the basics of its original release, and that it saw no &quot;fundamental conflicts&quot; between that basic position and that of a written statement Steyn had released on Friday last week. In fact, there were differences between what Steyn was reported to have said in media interviews, and Boraine's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine maintained in his later statement &quot;the fact was that three generals whose names appeared in the report ... were asked by ... De Klerk to recommend the names of those against whom action should take place&quot;. Steyn reportedly said at the weekend that his report had not recommended action against Meiring, then still army chief, General Kat Liebenberg, then defence force chief and General Joffel van der Westhuizen, then chief of military intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Mail &amp; Guardian has it on good authority that Steyn's report did, in fact, urge that the generals be investigated for their alleged neglect to take action where earlier investigations had implicated defence force members.  Steyn's report also raised specific allegations against all three generals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meiring said in a statement: &quot;It would appear that to date no substantiation for the allegations in the (Steyn) report could be found.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steyn was not available for further comment this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, NP secretary general Roelf Meyer this week confirmed as &quot; reasonable&quot; an interpretation that De Klerk's action on the Steyn report had been tempered by fears that excessive action could have led to a military revolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer said: &quot;At that stage there had been no agreement yet over the constitutional way ahead ... Codesa II had collapsed by then, and there were no official negotiations. There was probably the potential that people in military circles would have said, 'There is no certainty, let's take matters into our own hands.' I am not saying that they had that in mind, but there was the potential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela has also been in possession of Steyn's report since some time after the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - The police officer investigating the rape on Robben Island of political activist Nomboniso Gasa this week was himself accused of rape six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Kevin Jones was tried in the Wynberg Magistrates Court for the rape of Abby Duncan, then 13 years old, and though he was acquitted in March 1993, the magistrate himself, AP Kotze, stressed that it did not mean he was innocent of the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kotze said that he regretted he could not convict Jones, but had no choice because Duncan had contradicted herself under cross-examination, and because the state had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal police inquiry found Jones guilty of misconduct; he paid an admission of guilt fine of R150 in September 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abby Duncan left South Africa after that. She is 19 now, married and living in London. Contacted by the Mail &amp; Guardian this week she spoke publicly for the first time about her experience, and she had a message for Gasa: &quot;Believe that justice will be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa, 29, was attacked while staying overnight on Robben Island. She is employed by the Mayibuye Centre,which is establishing a museum on the Island.  Gasa, who was recently nominated as a member of the National Gender Commission, is married to ANC MP Raymond Suttner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa herself spoke out on Thursday, because she said she did not want to carry her burden in silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not want to be burdened by shame that is usually carried by women who have gone through this experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not want to be reduced to merely being a victim. I've decided to talk about my experience because I feel that the rapist, whether he is arrested or not, wherever he is, has to deal with the human aspect of his assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe that my name being mentioned and my talking publicly may force him and others like him to confront what they have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said to be raped on Robben Island was a &quot;double violation&quot;, of herself and of the attempts being made to transform the Island into a place of peace and tranquility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This place has a history of pain and suffering and one would have thought all South Africans would want to embrace it as a significant symbol of our history, the process of reconciling and building peace in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'To me Robben Island is sacred ground, it will remain so even after this experience. The struggle for change is painful for all of us, I presume from what this man said to me that he himself is struggling with this. I am angry, very angry that he has chosen my body as a battleground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She criticised the police handling of her case saying she expected to be treated with &quot;care, gentleness and respect&quot; and had not received such treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice of Jones as an investigating officer could only add insult to Gasa's injury. It was without irony that a police spokesman said this Thursday that Jones was chosen because the original investigating officer &quot; did not have the experience to deal with an offence of such a serious nature&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991 Jones was an officer with the Child Protection Unit, assigned to investigate allegations by Abby Duncan and her parents that she had been abused by a school teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few weeks after Jones began his investigation, Duncan's family laid charges against him, alleging that he had sexual intercourse with the young girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his trial in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court, Jones was transferred from Child Protection to CID, but at the same time, he was promoted to the rank of detective warrant-officer. He has since been promoted again, to the rank of captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan spoke out this week, she said, because she believed strongly Gasa needed her assistance, not only to deal with the trauma but also as a warning not to trust the officer assigned to her case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopefully two rapists can now be brought to justice by one case,&quot; she said.  &quot;The police and the justice system let me and other unreported victims of Kevin Jones down when he was promoted to the rank of captain after my trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The news that he was now investigating Ms Gasa's case hit me hard because my family had been assured by the police hierarchy that he would never be allowed to investigate another rape case again. It has been proven that he is not able to perform with honesty and integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it inconceivable that he has been put in charge of this case. It is like the blind leading the blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - THE SABC has temporarily frozen plans to drop the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) because the corporation's actions apparently breach key sections of the new Labour Relations Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio chief Govin Reddy admitted this week he had erred in his execution of the decision. He confirmed the SABC had not taken legal advice before attempting to fire the 80-person orchestra, which is employed and subsidised by the SABC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The botched retrenchments come ahead of major cutbacks at the SABC. The corporation said the decision to axe the orchestra was endorsed by leading consultants McKinsey which, for a R6-million fee, is helping the SABC trim its operations. The consultants are understood to have earmarked 500 to 1200 other jobs for the chopping block this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union officials and orchestra members say the announcment to axe the NSO came without warning, constituting a breach of the Labour Relations Act, which demands thorough consultation with employees before they are retrenched.  The orchestra has demanded detailed information from the SABC explaining the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anton Meyer, radio park regional chairman for the Broadcasting, Electronic Media and Allied Workers Union, accused the SABC of &quot;blatant incompetence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He quoted from a note Reddy sent this week to Solly Mokoetle, who previously worked for the African National Congress's Radio Freedom and is now a senior general manager in charge of strategic planning, which said: &quot;We have run into trouble with the union. Before the consultative process can begin, they require a great deal of information ...&quot; It is understood the SABC's labour department was not consulted on the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Rogers, spokesman for the orchestra, says there will be no negotiations until the NSO receives the requested information, which includes details of the corporation's financial state. The SABC has held fire on its retrenchment letters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporation has agreed to give the orchestra the information it wants, but NSO members fear that once they have the information, and consult, the SABC will simply have another stab at firing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the legal bungle, the SABC is sticking to its guns. Orchestra members were notified this week that &quot;we (the SABC) want to stress that no decision has been taken except that which has been announced&quot;. Reddy said it was unlikely the decision would be reversed after negotiations as there was, quite simply, not enough money for the orchestra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orchestra has received several offers of free legal advice from top Johannesburg law firms. The union claims unfair dismissal entitles an employee to 12 months' compensation, which would cost the SABC about R6- million in addition to retrenchment packages. The corporation subsidises the orchestra to the tune of R15-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether the orchestra was consulted in the run-up to the decision, Reddy told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week &quot;consultations with unions representing the staff are currently under way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC's decision to stop funding the orchestra is at odds with a June 1994 document it prepared on its role as a public broadcaster. The document, entitled Delivering Value, said: &quot;The SABC believes it should retain interest in the orchestra in order to ensure the viability of the NSO as a national asset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy said this week: &quot;Why should the public broadcaster and not the state or private sector fund the NSO?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the cash-strapped organisation had been forced to prioritise and that the future of the NSO had been in doubt for some time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - SPORTS Minister Steve Tshwete this week expressed strong concernabout the administration of athletics in South Africa following threats to the safety of Olympic silver medallist Hezekiel Sepeng before an athletics meeting at the University of Stellenbosch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting passed without incident - Sepeng won the mile - but tensions remain as opposing organisations compete for control of athletics in the Boland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this week a spokesman for Tshwete said a commission of inquiry, similar to the recent Pickard Commission of Inquiry into the affairs of soccer, could not be ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble has been brewing in the Boland for some time, but the problems came to a head shortly before Monday's annual Weetbix meet at the Coetzenburg Stadium, when a group called People Against Racism in Sport (Paris) threatened to disrupt the meet. Headed by Wilf Daniels, convenor of Athletics South Africa's coaching commission and a member of the Boland athletics development committee, Paris claimed its actions were aimed at &quot;ridding South African sport of racism&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe my actions will hurt white South Africa, but until there is no more racism in sport in the country I think it is unfair that overseas athletes take part in local meetings,&quot; Daniels told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the athletes scheduled to appear at Monday's meet were British runner Sally Gunnell, the 1992 Olympic 400m hurdles champion. Gunnell withdrew from the meet - &quot;due to a calf injury&quot;, according to meet promoter Johan Fourie.  She was the only international athlete to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniels confirmed he had spoken to Gunnell, and insisted she had bowed to political pressure from Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy over the meeting was compounded when Charles Beukes, a Boland athletics administrator and Athletics South Africa (ASA) executive committee member, called Sepeng's coach, JP van der Merwe, on Sunday and warned him that he could not guarantee Sepeng's safety if he competed at the meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniels also called Van der Merwe and tried to convince him to stop Sepeng from competing. He then placed a phone call to Sepeng himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'Don't even think about coming to Stellenbosch,'&quot; Sepeng recalled.  &quot;I asked him why and he said, 'You know the problems we are having between blacks and whites down here.' He said Stellenbosch is a racist club and I must support him by not competing at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just told him I don't have any racial problems and he mustn't involve me with his politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniels told Sepeng he had the backing of ASA, but when Sepeng spoke with Banele Sindani, its secretary general, Sindani told him he should compete in the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sindani told the M&amp;G that Beukes's actions were &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, and that ASA was conducting an inquiry into the incident. &quot;We must make sure nothing interferes with the performances of our athletes. ASA will certainly take the matter further, and will take the appropriate steps, if neccesary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems in Boland athletics may have less to do with competition among athletes than with competition among administrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration of athletics in Boland has been split since October 1995, when the executive of the province denied voting rights to new clubs who were forced to join from the Western Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conwal du Plessis, a leading administrator in the province, instituted a court action after he was denied the right to call a general meeting of the executive to discuss the voting issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Supreme Court found in favour of Du Plessis and against Beukes, who was president of the province at the time. Du Plessis was subsequently elected as president on September 23 1996. Beukes was given the right to appeal this decision, but has not yet decided whether he will do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beukes has maintained throughout that Athletics Boland has retained too many white administrators from apartheid days and that it has not done enough for the development of disadvantaged athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feud has prompted the National Sports Council to appoint a temporary athletics administrator for the province. The administrator, advocate Norman Arendse, is also heading a commission of inquiry into athletics in the Boland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arendse said that the Cape Town Olympic bid company has expressed concern about the situation in the Boland. According to Arendse, Daniels had contacted the British Olympic Committee to complain about Gunnell taking part in the Weetbix meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe, Sepeng's coach, also deplored the action of Beukes and Daniels. &quot;This sort of action makes me feel that athletics is moving backwards and shows that we have a long way to go before our house is clean.  Although most provinces in the country are free of wrangling, the problems in the Boland need to be sorted out. A lot of fingers have been pointed and I think it is time that someone intervenes in the situation, maybe even the government,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Sports Council chief executive Mvuso Mbebe said he felt the problems in the Boland would be sorted out without government interference, but Zipphorah Mothoa, a spokesman for Tshwete, confirmed that the minister was looking into the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Paris's effect on Boland athletics proved minimal this week. The threatened protest on Monday did not materialise and the meeting went ahead as scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is time for administrators to forget about themselves and think about the athletes,&quot; Sepeng said. &quot;Athletics is my job. Not only to run but also to promote the sport. The administrators must sort the problems out soon.  &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - THE extraordinary Cabinet meeting this week in which ministers stood up and applauded a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in Aids research raises intriguing questions about Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma's approach to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still smarting from the R14,2-million Sarafina II debacle, Zuma turned down the scientists' request for funding from her department late last year, claiming she could not authorise the R3,7-million they wanted. Instead Zuma directed them to the Cabinet, personally arranging Wednesday's audience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her spokesman, Vincent Hlongwane, said on Thursday that decision was because the Aids crisis &quot;is not the preserve of the Department of Health&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuma's funding stance does, however, seem strange, given the R40-million assigned this year to her department's HIV/Sexually Transmitted Diseases Directorate, which counts research among its various operations. The directive - the government's main Aids initiative - also has European Union money and a hefty budget from the RDP at its disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear what role the directive played in bringing the Pretoria treatment to the fore. New head Rose Smart was out of the country this week, and health department director general Olive Shisana was not taking calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cabinet meeting is a slap in the face for funding agencies like the Medical Research Council and the Foundation for Research Development, which apply strict criteria when funding scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also comes at a time when subsidies to universities (and, consequently, university research) have been slashed, leaving many scientists scrabbling for funds. They feel the rules of fairness have been breached, as they have to go through a set of processes to earn the right to funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zigi Visser, husband of researcher Olga Visser, said Zuma had &quot;supported them&quot; when they were being &quot;blocked&quot; in their research. It was Zuma who set up the Cabinet meeting, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Peter Owen, a medical professional at the University of Western Cape, who helped develop the African National Congress's health policy before 1994, said: &quot;The minister herself used to work in the Medical Research Council - how could she allow something like this to get to the Cabinet? Any Tom, Dick or Harry can now come forward to the Cabinet with the flimsiest evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - THREE Pretoria scientists broke every rule of scientific method this week when they took their research to a Cabinet meeting, saying they might have a cure for Aids. But the man representing them says they did this because they had been &quot;blocked&quot; by the Aids research establishment, who refused to collaborate with them when they wouldn't share their patent rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three scientists, who are attached to the University of Pretoria - cryogenics researcher Olga Visser, and cardio-thoracic surgeons Professor Dirk du Plessis and Dr Kallie Landauer - have patented a formula they call Virodene, which they say kills HIV. They presented their findings to the Cabinet this week and asked for R3,7- million to continue their research.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the government would consider funding the scientists, and members of the Cabinet applauded at the end of the presentation, real doubts have emerged about the validity of the research. These include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The National Institute of Virology has confirmed that the researchers approached the institute some months ago and asked it to run laboratory tests on certain compounds. HIV research specialist Dr Des Martin said the tests had been inconclusive - in other words, had no effect on the virus. However, he said he didn't know whether the substances they had tested were the constituents of Virodene, as the researchers could have changed the formulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The researchers have not submitted their work for peer review (either by publishing, announcing their findings at the recent Aids conference in the United States, or presenting it to experts in the field of HIV research).  They have also not released the details of the compound called Virodene, which it makes it difficult to assess the validity of their conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dean of the University of Cape Town's Medical School, Professor JP van Niekerk, said: &quot;We don't know enough to comment properly, because we were informed by the media. It would be usual if there was a breakthrough of a medical kind to first inform the scientific community, which would need to hear it and evaluate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zigi Visser, Olga Visser's husband, who is representing the researchers, said they &quot;have been blocked&quot; by the Aids establishment, and implied that they had received little co-operation because they weren't prepared to share their patent rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The strongest evidence was human - the patients themselves, who told the Cabinet that their condition had miraculously improved. But David Spencer, who runs the Johannesburg Hospital's Aids clinic, said it was not possible to assess the trial because the researchers have not shown what controls they used. &quot;We need to know that they controlled for other drugs, for example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical Research Council president Dr Walter Prozesky said testing the drug on 12 patients was known, in pharmacological practice, as a Phase 1 trial. &quot; There are many Phase 1 trials for drugs run all over the world, but they don't give the correct answers. They don't give the side effects, which only become known after a few years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An HIV researcher from the Aaron Diamond Aids Research Centre in New York called the scientific evidence presented in a South African Press Association story on how Virodene works &quot;far-fetched&quot;. The story quoted Visser saying Virodene attacks the RNA of the virus. However, the researcher pointed out that Visser has not explained how Virodene distinguishes between human RNA (made up of the same basic building blocks as the viral RNA) and the viral RNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The researchers are not experts in HIV, or in virology and microbiology.  The Medical Research Council, which funds the work of medical scientists, has no record of any of the researchers receiving grants or awards from the council in the past 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria University was unable to provide curriculum vitae for the scientists, or information on their research achievements and funding.  However, the researchers have had some international success in their field of cryogenics - the preserving of live organs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A senior Aids researcher at a leading drug company said it appeared irresponsible of the scientists to make such a fanfare when they had not put their drug through controlled clinical tests. It was very unusual to approach the government directly for funding. If the team had approached his company or any other company, their work would have been given very serious consideration. &quot;The money involved in Aids drugs is huge. Any company would be mad to pass up an opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zigi Visser said: &quot;We did follow procedures, going to major pharmaceutical companies, who originally supported us, but as soon as results began to prove more and more successful, they pulled out,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some of the companies wanted them to give them substantial shares of the patent in order to continue with the research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we realised some people were not happy with what we are doing, we went underground and had to pay for the research ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ute Jentsch of the South African Medical Research Institute, a microbiologist with an interest in Aids, said she had not heard of the Pretoria University work until Wednesday's press announcement. She said all new treatments had to be approached with a degree of scepticism until controlled clinical tests had been executed. &quot;Lots of people claim breakthroughs which come to nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the doubts, it seems unlikely three established scientists would go public in this fashion if they did not have good evidence that Virodene works.  And, according to Zigi Visser, all the research to date - about R800 000 worth - had been funded by his wife and himself, an investment they would have been unlikely to make without some hope of a return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the researchers had taken their work to HIV experts, who sometimes helped them, but they always hit problems &quot;when the subject of patents came up&quot;. They would be publishing in the next few months, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three researchers want to experiment on 30 more people within the next six months, and hope to have the medicine commercially available by 2000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - DISSENT over the Mpumalanga Parks Board's (MPB) decision to place its prime nature reserves in the hands of the shadowy Dubai- based Dolphin Group deepened this week with the resignation of one of the provincial parks board's most influential members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Hanks, who is also executive director of Worldwide Fund for Nature South Africa, resigned on Wednesday to protest the manner in which the parks board &quot;steamrollered&quot; the secret deal without presenting it to the full board or consulting affected communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his resignation letter, Hanks also asked why he had not yet received a response to a formal letter of protest he sent to board chairman Patrick Maduna on November 29 last year. In the letter he asked six questions about the board's handling of the deal, and about the financial credibility of Dolphin Group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract, details of which were secret until reported by the Mail &amp; Guardian, grants Dolphin exclusive commercial rights to Mpumalanga's most popular nature reserves, including the Blyde River Canyon, for the next 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parks board not only failed to mention Hanks's letter, but the issues he raised were not addressed during a seven-hour crisis meeting between the parks board and the provincial watchdog Environmental Council (EC) late last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting was a complete waste of time,&quot; Hanks said. &quot;It's really a hopeless situation when not even the (parks) board's own board is consulted on what is potentially the most important conservation deal ever in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanks said board members were not informed that the meeting was to address the Dolphin case. &quot;All we were told was that it would be a normal board meeting,&quot; he said. &quot;I just cannot go on like this and so I submitted my resignation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, he said, the meeting failed to address the concerns of the EC and other environmentalists. And a press statement by Maduna afterwards has angered land-reform lawyers, who accuse the parks board of failing to take seriously potential land claims involving such areas as the Blyde River Canyon and Koskop Dam, dismissing them as &quot;irrelevant issues that cannot stand in the way of development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do they mean by 'irrelevant'. They're a state body operating on state land and as such cannot contradict core central government policies such as the land reform programme,&quot; said Durkje Gilfillian, an attorney with the Legal Resources Centre in Pretoria. &quot;Some of these claims were lodged as far back as August 1995 but the parks board has ignored them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPB chief executive Alan Gray, who masterminded the Dolphin deal, refused to comment on Hanks's resignation, or on reports in the M&amp;G last week that the Dolphin Group and its chief executive Ketan Somaia are under investigation in Kenya for misappropriating R35-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have done my homework,&quot; he told the M&amp;G, refusing to elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray said he went to Kenya to check on Somaia and Dolphin, and was satisfied with his findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the time of his visit, the Kenyan media were reporting Somaia's business dealings under such headlines as: &quot;Loathed and despised.&quot; There were also reports on his alleged refusal to heed three summonses to appear before a parliamentary Public Accounts Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee chairman M Wamalwa confirmed that his committee had recommended that the government refrain from future contracts with any company associated with Somaia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Somaia and a delegation of Dubai businessmen visited Namibia two weeks ago, following a meeting with Namibia's trade and industry minister.  Reports in the Namibian press indicate that he is interested in buying into the Swakopmund Entertainment Centre, which includes a casino, as well as a private game reserve reportedly owned by Stocks &amp; Stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G confirmed this week that Dolphin is negotiating local financing for the developments with at least two commercial banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources indicate that Dolphin hopes to obtain at least 40% of its investment capital from the South African market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga environmental affairs MEC David Mkwanazi said he could not accept that the entire contract was flawed. &quot;It is all a matter of interpretation and now that we know there are certain problems we can renegotiate the points,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pallo Jordan, minister of environmental affairs and tourism, this week requested a copy of the contract and a background briefing on Dolphin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG - SABC this week hastily unbanned a Prophets of da City video after it won a prestigious international award.Charl Blignaut reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAPE Flats hip-hop outfit Prophets of da City scooped the prize for Best Music Video/Clip from Non-Francophone Africa at the prestigious annual Cannes Midem international music awards this week. But, while in France a clip off the video was being screened at a glittering ceremony, back home it was revealed that the video was still banned from airplay on SABC-TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The R42 000 Midem award went to the Prophets's co-manager, Lance Stehr, who directed the video for their song Understand Where I'm Coming From off their breakthrough album Age of Truth (1993).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally screened in 1993/94 on two of the corporation's most popular music shows, Studio Mix and Ezimtoti, the music video picked up on the latent street-level frustration of the country's youth before the 1994 elections.  But when the SABC bosses saw it, they were outraged by its &quot;spirit of violence&quot; and banned it outright. Ironically, the video was awarded Ezimtoti's Music Video of the Year Award in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lobbied by Stehr, the SABC music video committee promised to review the banning after the elections. But the committee decided to uphold the ban as the video, it said, did not endorse the spirit of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the video was nominated for a First National Bank South African Music Awards (Sama) prize in 1995, the SABC had no option but to allow a clip to be screened. But still the ban was not revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted this Wednesday by a cultural show on SABC3 for permission to screen the video, the show's producers were told this would not be possible as an outright ban existed on the material. When approached for confirmation by the Mail &amp; Guardian at 10am on Wednesday, an employee at the SABC's Dramatic and Literary Rights Organisation (Dalro) office reiterated that the video was banned but said the ban could be revised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When pressed for further comment, it was later disclosed that the committee met at 2pm that afternoon and, without any further ado, proceeded to lift the four-year ban. A publicist at the corporation then contacted the M&amp;G to say that the video was, in fact, not banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, at least three members of the current committee - Dave McBirnie (chair), Noleen McKenzie and Belinda Beneke (all from the Dalro office) - were also on the committee that originally banned the video. Other members present this week included SABC-TV music programme producers Thami Shabangu, Joe Correia and Melanie Son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of going to press no official banned video revision policy was offered by the corporation's policy-makers. Programme producers at the SABC disclosed, however, that a lengthy list of banned videos existed - most of these international - and that these were revised only if Dalro was lobbied by producers or interested parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Age of Truth album was also a victim of a 1993 SABC radio ban - 15 of its 21 tracks were prohibited, but not Understand Where I'm Coming From. This proceeded to reach the number one spot on Radio Metro - but fans were not allowed to see the matching images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Stehr, the 15 songs are still banned on the SABC. But when approached for comment this week SABC radio boss Govin Reddy said that, as far as he was concerned, no political bannings could be upheld in the new South Africa. Still, he admitted that no firm banning revision policy existed at SABC radio besides a standard committee similar to the television committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music video producers have for a long time expressed concern at the SABC's tight control of music videos. The SABC puts up a third of a video's budget and then insists that record companies join the umbrella music body Association for the South African Music Industry before they can receive screening on the public broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC also has the creative power to veto video pitches, and insists that often cash-strapped production houses put up the capital for all videos, paying them 30 to 60 days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irritated and disillusioned with the local music industry, Prophets of da City went to London and a lucrative deal with leading label Beggar's Banquet in 1995. They have recently returned and their new album, Ghetto Code, is due out at the end of February.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Unnecessary harassment of journalists gives a bad impression of Zambia overseas and should be avoided, advised Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA) chairman David Simpson yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on Wednesday's brief detention of Post Newspaper reporter, Kunda Mwila for effecting a citizen's arrest of a police officer who was impersonating a Chronicle Newspaper reporter, Simpson said it was unfortunate that the government finds it necessary to resort to the Second Republic practice of infiltrating the ranks of various organisations, and especially the media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To detain a reporter on a charge of 'conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace', when in fact he was simply exercising his rights as a citizen, is unacceptable,&quot;Simpson said in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday.&quot; This creates an atmosphere of suspicion which is inappropriate for a liberal democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the charge of 'conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace' is one of the many laws that needed to be re-examined because it can too easily be abused to harass individuals on baseless personal grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZIMA chairman appealed to the government to avoid unnecessary harassment of media personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such acts are widely reported overseas and tend to give a bad impression of Zambia. The blame for this is then placed on the media, instead of where it rightly belongs,&quot; Simpson said, adding: &quot;Moreover it is becoming tedious to have to issue protest statements almost daily.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodimiza Mines, in their affidavit, revealed that they had received &quot; disturbing news from persons concerned with this liquidation, but who do not want to be named for fear of recriminations, that the liquidator has sold a number of assets of the respondent bank ostensible in the course of the liquidation and unfortunately quite a substantial portion of this exceeding 75 per cent has been used to pay substantial &quot;remuneration&quot; to the liquidator running into millions of Kwacha per month and this is at a time when the creditors and the depositors have received nothing,&quot; read the affidavit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodimiza Mines, in their affidavit, said they were informed by such persons that at one time the Bank of Zambia engaged a liquidator from South Africa as there was nobody in Zambia who could do the job. His expenses, comprising of weekly air fares, hotel expenses, transport, etc, were paid from the proceeds of the liquidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The liquidator is required by law to convene at least one general meeting of the creditors at which he must table his account of his actions and dealings in the litigation and to my knowledge this has not been done,&quot; read in part the Sodimiza Mines affidavit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodimiza Mines, through there lawyer Mwanawasa, applied that orders be made to review remuneration of the liquidator following Section 320 (3) of the Companies Act 1994 and to compel the liquidator to convene a general meeting of the company under Section 323(1) and to determine whether it is lawful or proper for the liquidator to keep the company's creditors and depositors uninformed of his acts and dealings and of the conduct of the liquidation, under Section 326 of the Companies Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A top World Bank official, John Todd, this week blew the lid off a deal with government exposing a joint intention to introduce legislation to control the press and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Todd told a meeting he called with Lusaka based NGOs that the bank and the Zambian government had reached an undertaking last year to satisfy a number of benchmarks by December of last year prior to future negotiations on aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This deadline was moved to March this year after the Bank gave consideration to last year's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the agreed benchmarks was enactment of a regulatory policy on the press and NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Todd also revealed to the same gathering, held at the World Vision offices in Woodlands on Monday, that the Zambian Land Act was the work of a South African Peter Moll, now a World Bank employee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both revelations stunned the NGOs leaders who immediately took on Todd, demanding to know the motive of the World Bank/Zambian government alliance.  They also questioned the relevance of any further consultations on a pre- determined matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the NGOs who attended Monday's meeting are World Vision, Afronet, Women for Change and NGO Co-ordinating Committee and Zambia Civic Education Association(ZCEA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least three of the NGOs were by yesterday plotting international protests against Todd's revelations while ZCEA chairperson, Lucy Sichone, had written a four page harsh petition to Todd with copies to the World Bank president and the entire donor community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the World Bank was populated by human beings, as understood, they would not have signed a co-agreement with another human government that deprives another person of the rights to life, liberty, freedom of expression, of the press, assembly, association and the God-given and inalienable right to land,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the coming legislation it is envisaged that government would sanction all donations to NGOs, and regulate their operations. It would do the same to the press, licensing journalists and regulating their practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motive for this apparently contradictory position by the Bank is not yet clear. Speculation is, however, high among NGOs that the World Bank may be moving along a government move either out of ignorance or to shield its harsh policies from critical attacks by NGOs and the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You contracted with our animal farm government to outlaw all rights and freedoms in order to protect your inhuman policies from being questioned,&quot; Sichone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This position appeared justified after revelations by Todd that the land Act, by far the country's most controversial piece of legislation since MMD rule, was sponsored by the World Bank. NGOs and the press have been highly critical of this law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Todd told NGOs, he supported the Land Act which was drafted by a man he highly rates, Peter Moll. He disputed claims by NGOs that Moll's Land Act transplanted the apartheid spirit into Zambia, saying Moll was a noble man who refused to fight in the South African army for the love of man and ended up in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs dismissed this as a cheap reference to respect for humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You hypocrite Todd, have you never heard of Robben Island, Nelson Mandela, Steve Biko, the Sharpeville massacres. Those men and women who defied apartheid on political grounds did not spend their time in comfortable prison cells (like Moll) from which they emerged to work for the World Bank, they were murdered and killed in cold blood, they spent their most productive years at Robben Island, their marriages and family were destroyed,&quot; Sichone said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted from his room at Hotel Intercontinental in Lusaka Todd confirmed a World Bank-Zambian government meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We discussed the NGO policy but we only encouraged the government to see how it can create a mutual relationship with NGOs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the encouragement included legislation, Todd replied: &quot;If legislation is part of the solution yes but we never said anything on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed he has been misunderstood: &quot;We have no position on NGOs and the media in Zambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Afronet director, Ngande Mwananjiti, believes the World Bank is uncertain about what it is backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bank itself seems confused about what it needs. What is clear from what Todd told us, is that they endorsed government plan on legislating against NGOs . The ongoing plan is therefore with their blessing,&quot; Mwanajiti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the concern of NGOs is that the two sides have a set position and are making dialogue a mockery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whilst government is giving us an impression it wants to dialogue with us first, the World Bank has given us the opposite signal,&quot; Mwanajiti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the solution does not however lie in legislation but the political will of NGOs to survive and defy the wrong thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women for Change executive director, Emily Sikazwe, said her organisation would resist any move by anyone to legislate against NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether it is World Bank sponsored or not we shall not accept regulation,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikazwe who also confirmed Todd's disclosure of government moves on NGOs and the media said it was however likely that government would defy them and legislate. She cited examples of the Constitution, Nikuv,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land Act, and elections as cases were public opinion has not mattered to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not a supper body so we are not optimistic that legislation won't take place, but nothing defeats our resolve to own and enjoy our rights. No law shall take that away from us,&quot; Sikazwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sichone deplored the use of apartheid methods to control Zambia saying the country has people intelligent enough to determine their destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under apartheid, South Africa had a media council, regulated freedoms of assembly and association and used the land Act to displace the local people in exactly the same way as 'the Boers on the World Bank' are doing to Zambia,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She appealed to the donor community, as members of the World Bank, to stop the legislation of the media council and NGO bureau and review the Word Bank charter, character and qualification of personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donors funding the world bank have come to accept without exception the common humanity of all people as one family. It is this acceptance that is at the root of tying aid to the rights and freedoms of individuals in my country, &quot; she said. &quot;It was therefore unacceptable for the Bank to encourage and abet crimes that have defied humanity on the basis of economic benchmarks narrowly defined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sichone suggested that the Bank &quot;created in the cold war to check anti- communist dictatorships&quot; should fold if its usefulness is no more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank has often taken a different position on Zambia from other donors. When almost all donors froze aid to Zambia over the constitution and elections, the Bank announced the release of US $90 million with praise about her performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towards the end of last year and parts of this year government has been making pronouncements in favour of legislation. A meeting it called a few weeks ago at Kafue Gorge to get NGOs approve a draft regulatory policy flopped after NGOs threw it out. Government declared it would find another way into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International human rights and media organisations around the world,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including Reporters San Frontiers, in Paris, Committee for Protection of Journalists in New York , the Freedom Forum in Washington, the Commonwealth Press Union in England and Media Institute of Southern Africa in Windhoek said they are now studying the World Bank position.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - It is disheartening, but not surprising, to learn that the World Bank is in league with the Zambian government to enact laws that will curb the activities and limit the capacity of the independent press and Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank, and its 'sister' institution - the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have every 'good' reason for not liking the independent press and NGOs. They have never been bedfellows with NGOs, especially grassroot ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelations in Lusaka this week by World Bank official, John Todd, that his organisation was working with the Zambian government on media and NGO legislation, as they had done on the unpopular Land Act, speaks volumes about the institution's political morality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank is one of the most powerful institutions in the world. Along with the IMF, it is playing a very crucial role in the reorganisation of global production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For poor Third World journalists and NGO leaders to confront and challenge the philosophy and epistemology of an institution, like the World Bank, that has the power to implement this systematic process of re-colonisation requires a tremendous amount of courage and conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last years of this century and millennium have been characterised by sweeping political and economic change. Demonstrating the power of grassroot political mobilisation, the forces behind this change quickly challenged established centres of political and economic power. The common denominator of the demands generated by these forces has been insistence upon accountability to those whose lives are directly affected by those who wield power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unlikely that this contagious mass mobilisation will be easily contained in one region of the world. Nor is it likely to be confined to producing change only in national governments. Established economic and political institutions everywhere are going to be, in the years ahead, subject to demands for greater accountability for their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accountability is, in the final analysis, what Emily Sikazwe of Women for Change, Lucy Sichone of Zambia Civic Education Association and us, through this editorial comment, are trying to achieve from the World Bank and Zambian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By exposing what the World Bank's connivance with the Zambian to curb the scope of press and NGOs' activities, the groundwork, albeit weak, is being laid for imposing on the Bank new standards of accountability to the institutions and people affected by its actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, the World Bank has been primarily accountable to those who have provided the lion's share of its financial resources. This is no longer enough. We - the citizens of the world - are all stakeholders in the World Bank. And those who have the greatest stake are the citizens of countries that have had to endure the harsh economic and political adjustments imposed by the World Bank as a condition of its providing assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank needs to change its ways and attitudes. If it does not change it may lose its relevance in today's fast changing world where the struggle for human rights is getting higher and higher on the political agendas of most nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank has paid very little attention, if any, to good governance in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When most of the country's cooperating partners were pushing the Zambia government to adhere to good governance, international civil servants in charge of the World Bank were letting them of the hook with new disbursements and praises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know it is not easy to take on the World Bank but most NGOs leaders will not be defeated by this weight. They will reject and fight World Bank's bad laws agreed to by their weak, spineless and uncreative politicians in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only through struggle that the World Bank &quot;Goliath&quot; will be tamed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A bid by The Weekly Express to set aside a judgement in which the High Court had granted K55 million to Catholic priest Father Davoli Umberto in damages against the newspaper was yesterday lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Registrar of the High Court in Ndola, Mwambazi Chitika, yesterday threw out the application with costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action was taken when the newspaper's advocates failed to show up at the hearing set for yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, judgement had been delivered in default against the International Book Company Africa Limited which owns The Weekly Express on April 2,1996, after lawyers for the newspaper had consistently missed a number of hearing dates set by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following delivery of the judgement, The Weekly Express applied on September 25, 1996 that the judgement in default be set aside but they were again absent at yesterday's hearing of their case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel for Fr Umberto, Levy Mwanawasa, said the lawyer for The Weekly Express, A. Mbushi, had withdrawn from the case two days before the hearing and had given notice of his withdrawal to Fr Umberto's lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no representative from The Weekly Express came forward to defend the paper yesterday prompting the deputy registrar to order that the papers application be thrown out and an order to pay the earlier decreed figure of K55 million with interest be upheld. The new amount may run close to K100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Express had in various articles complained of, allegedly portrayed Fr Umberto as an immoral priest and one working against the interests of the MMD government and called for his deportation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Some pre-packed products are weighing lower than what is indicated on labels, revealed commerce, trade and industry deputy minister Ackim Nkole yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkole yesterday also accused retailers of evading tax by using street vendors to sell their products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commerce, trade and industry deputy minister, carrying out a random survey at leading shops in Lusaka yesterday, charged that manufacturers were cheating the Zambian people. He said he was disappointed, especially with bread and mealie meal, which were notoriously sold underweight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is mostly with pre-packed products and they are cheating. While the labels, on the product indicate a higher weight, when the actual weight is lower,&quot; Nkole said. &quot; According to the law (Cap 707) this is unfair trading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned manufacturers who are selling underweight products to clean up their act or face the wrath of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkole said his ministry has received complaints on the weight of products and decided to take a hard-line stance on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From today we shall carry out random checks on these shops. We want Zambians to be paying the right amount for the right weight of products,&quot; Nkole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkole also gave Shoprite and Melissa 48 hours in which to produce their 1997 trading licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, Nkole visited Melissa, Shoprite, Gift Box, Limbada, Helium and Castle shops where he found that most products were underweight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shoprite Checkers manager, Basil Hajivasiliou, attributed the problem to poor packaging while Castle's manager, John Ioannou, blamed his measuring scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Nkole said his ministry would severely deal with retailers who used street vendors to evade tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall not harass the street vendors but we are going to deal with those that supply the boys and are creating artificial employment,&quot; he warned. &quot; That is money-laundering because no one is accounting for the money obtained from the street vending sells.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Limbada general manager, Rashid Ackman, said shop owners were wary of dealing with street vendors because &quot;they are the Office of the President&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being the Office of the President, the vendors do what they like. They are creating a hassle and people are even afraid of coming to town because of them,&quot; Ackman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helium acting manager, Anthony Pathy, denied supplying the vendors saying there appeared to be a conspiracy between his shop workers and the vendors to rob his shop of merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not supply the vendors. They do buy some items but the bulk is stolen from here. There seems to be a link between the people inside (the shop) and the vendors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Clearing of landmines is not one of the government's priorities and accordingly no funds have ever been allocated for such an exercise, disclosed Ministry of Defence spokesman, Major General Jack Mubanga, on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Mubanga, in an interview on Wednesday, said the landmine situation in the country has remained the same since 1994, when the Ministry of Defence had openly acknowledge it as a serious problem, due to non availability of funds to clear them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Interim chairman of the newly-formed Zambia Campaign to Ban Landmines (ZCBL), Johnson Sakala, said it was unfortunate if the landmine problem was not considered a priority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala said it was crucial that the issue is taken seriously because it affected the lives of people. He noted that in affected areas residents could not farm or collect firewood and that their lives were generally restricted because of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubanga said the government and the defence ministry had other priority tasks other than landmine clearing where the little available resources were being channeled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The landmines are still there but the government will only attend to this problem when funds are available,&quot; he said. &quot; At the moment there are other areas of priority in the defence force which have to be addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that what was important was that the people had been informed about the existence and the whereabouts of these landmines in different areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubanga told journalists in 1994 that Zambia still had uncleared landmines in Western, Southern and Lusaka Provinces which had remained after the liberation wars. And yesterday, he reiterated his position, saying nothing had changed since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Mubanga has, however, pledged that the Ministry of Defence will cooperate with the committee to sensitise the population on the subject of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that it was the duty of every Zambian to join this campaign in order to make the majority of the people aware of the existing problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Mubanga said Zambia was a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ of the Defence and Security at which level they deal with similar problems in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zambia was keen to attend the forthcoming Maputo Conference on &quot; Towards a Mine-Free Southern Africa&quot; which takes place in February to discuss with other member countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - MALAWIAN national team technical advisor Manfred Hoener has expressed fears over the absence of professionals from the squad that meets Zambia in the Africa Cup qualifier in Blantyre tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoener, a Germany national, was most worried about the South African based Charles Gondwe and Enerst Mtawali's absence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I foresee problems in the 'Flames' (Malawian national team) midfield if Gondwe and Mtawali do not show up,&quot; Hoener told Malawi's The Nation newspaper yesterday. &quot;The midfield definitely needs improvement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Hoener's concern about his side's weaknesses, the morale in his camp was said to be very high and the 'Flames' trainer, Reuben Malola, was confident his side will 'scotch' the Zambian side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every team plays the game to win and we are looking for that,&quot; Malola told The Nation yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the 'Flames' yesterday retreated to Blantyre after a two weeks camping at Kamuzu Academy, about 450 kilometres north of Blantyre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - There is no conspiracy to discredit or destroy Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) secretary general Bingu Wa Mutharika's reputation, said Malawi High Commissioner to Zambia, Reverend Emmanuel Chinkwita Phiri yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia's commerce, trade and industry minister Alfeyo Hambayi yesterday said the resolution to send Mutharika on forced leave was reached at after the committee of 14 ministers agreed unanimously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Commissioner Reverend Phiri, in an interview in Lusaka yesterday, said it is unfortunate Mutharika wants to politicise the issues at the COMESA secretariat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no personal vendetta from the government of Malawi against Dr Mutharika,&quot; High Commissioner Reverend Phiri said. &quot;We have done so much to promote COMESA, that is our interest. It would not help us in any way to be part of a campaign against him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hambayi said the committee was empowered under article 9 to met out such punishment and the probe team was legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika alleged at a press conference in Lusaka on Wednesday that COMESA Council of Ministers chairman, Malawi commerce and industry minister Chakakala Chaziya is behind the allegations of mismanagement and abuse of power leveled against him and would not accept the council's decision made through the manipulation of Chaziya to send him on forced leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Allegations of financial mismanagement and abuse of power against me are as a result of carefully calculated political conspiracy, to discredit my high reputation in Malawi, COMESA and the United Nations,&quot; Mutharika charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But High Commissioner Reverend Phiri said it is rather unfortunate that Mutharika has chosen to think the decision to send him on leave is the making of Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, it is not Dr Mutharika as an individual being probed but the secretariat as a whole, except that he had to go on leave to facilitate these investigations, and then the committee will make recommendations if necessary, no one has charged him yet,&quot; High Commissioner Reverend Phiri said. &quot;But if there are any serious allegations against him, its only proper that they are looked at and a report made.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)is being forced to import coal from Wankie Mine in Zimbabwe due to the closure of the Maamba coal mine after heavy floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCCM's Nkana division which uses the bulk of Maamba coal, at an average of 250 tonnes per day through its smelter, has already started importing coal from Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCCM, in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday, said it was not known when operations at the Maamba mine would return to normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The division (Nkana) is currently using its strategic stockpile of coal to ensure smelter operations continue uninterrupted,&quot; said the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said the Wankie coal would be delivered with added costs which were not tabulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some extra cost is involved since the Wankie coal has to be railed from Zimbabwe to Masuku Siding in Zambia which is an extra distance compared to the Maamba Coal trip from Masuku to Kitwe,&quot; noted the statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Konkola Deep Mining Project 'deal' is finally to be signed in February 1997 after three years of deliberations, revealed mines minister, Christon Tembo, in Parliament yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo, in a special address to the House on the progress being made in the mining sector, said the privatisation report submitted by NM Rothschilds of Britain had resulted in the packaging of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) into nine units. Already, he said, Kansanshi Copper Mine had been purchased by Cyprus Amax, a USA-based mining company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Development of the Konkola Deep negotiations have reached an advanced stage and the Memorandum of Understanding is to be signed in February,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stated that another agreement is soon to be signed by the government and South African mining company, AngloVaal, over the Konkola North orebody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during question time, Chipili MMD member of parliament, Ntondo Chindoloma, wondered why Cyprus Amax had been given a grace period of 30 months before having to add another US$5 million to the $3 million it has paid upfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo explained that mining was a large exercise and it would take time for the company to realise the payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MMD member of parliament for Pemba, Aaron Muyovwe, wanted to know the interest rates used in assessing the value of the mines and what was the value of the deposits. He also demanded the period of time over which the value had been calculated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo, replying to Muyovwe, said the question was &quot;outside the scope&quot; of his address. And in answer to a question on what would happen to the labour force, Tembo said the mine was being operated only on caretaker basis, but that the government would be in touch with the Mineworkers Union of Zambia to make sure that the workers were not inconvenienced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - DKT-Population Services International Ethiopia (DKT-PSI/E) is a non-profit, non-government organization that works in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health. DKT-PSI is now expanding its activities to include the promotion of family planning to accompany its ongoing efforts to promote AIDS prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of this new DKT-PSI initiative is to contribute substantially to accomplishing the specific objectives of the National Population Policy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1) A reduction of the current total fertility rate of 7.7 children per woman to approximately 4.0 by the year 2015.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2) An increase in the prevalence of contraceptive use from the current 4.0% to 44% by the year 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DKT-PSI Ethiopia focuses on AIDS prevention, and family planning by distributing primary health care products through its Ethiopia Social Marketing Program. DKT-PSI's approach to social marketing emphasizes three principles with regard to its products: availability, accessibility, affordability, and motivation to use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1990, the ESMP has sold 81,137,929 HIWOT brand condoms, including over 20 million in 1996. Now the ESMP is introducing a new low dose oral contraceptive pill under the brand name PRUDENCE Duofem. This is an important development as it will dramatically increase the accessibility and affordability of another effective and popular family planning method.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Duofem,&quot; a low dose oral contraceptive pill manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst International of U.S.A., will be branded for Ethiopia as &quot;PRUDENCE&quot;. Duofem is registered with the Pharmacy Department of the Ministry of Health, and is already on the market and available at pharmacies and drug shops in Addis Ababa. By the end of 1997, PRUDENCE Duofem oral contraceptive pills will be available in Pharmacies, Drug Shops, Private Clinics and Hospitals, Factory Clinics, Enterprise Health Facilities and Health Related NGOs in all of the major cities of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRUDENCE Duofem is presented in attractive single cycle packs.  Instructional inserts with information on dosage, contraindications and other related advice are prepared in Amahric and folded into the packs. Brochures and informational leaflets will also be available to the public. As the program is extended to the Regions, the inserts will be prepared in the appropriate languages. The price of one prudence cycle to retailers is sixty- five Ethiopian cents with the intent that customers will buy them for 1 Birr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information, education and communication (IEC) are in important part of any public health campaign. As such, it has been a principle tool of the ESMP in its AIDS prevention efforts to date. It will also be a significant element of this new family planning initiative, as the communications staff will be offering educational seminars and lectures for the public, and training workshops and seminars will be offered to all levels of family planing providers. These training and workshops will cover all aspects of reproductive health. It is anticipated that the ESMP will collaborate closely with community based distribution (CBD) efforts as they are implemented around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first five year period, the ESMP target will be to socially market over 8 million cycles of PRUDENCE Duofem which represents 676,985 Couple-Year of Protection (CYP): yielding a substantial 5% social marketing contribution to the contraceptive prevalence rate in the fifth year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having, in the last two weeks examined the beginnings of modernisation in the last part of Menilek's reign, we turn now to the political crises of the time:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Succession Problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last years of Menilek's reign, like those of several earlier Ethiopian rulers, were bedevilled by the problem of succession. This became particularly serious after 1904, when the Emperor's health began visually to deteriorate. The question of the royal inheritance was the more serious in that the ageing monarch by then had no recognised living son. The presumption was that the throne would pass to the monarch's cousin, Ras Makonnen, but he predeceased his ailing master in March 1906, thus leaving the succession wide open.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impending demise of Menilek, victor of Adwa and founder of the modern Ethiopian state, gave rise to the persuasive idea, on the part of European diplomats in Addis Ababa, that his empire, which they regarded as an anachronism in the era of the Scramble for Africa, would soon disintegrate.  The three neighbouring colonial powers, Britain, France and Italy, whom Menilek had played one against the other, now came together with a view to mutual cooperation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, and the French and Italian ambassadors in London accordingly signed a Tripartite Convention, on 13 December 1906. It declared, in Article 1, that it was the &quot;common interest&quot; of the three powers to &quot;maintain the integrity of Ethiopia&quot;, while &quot;arriving at an understanding as to their conduct in case of a change in the situation&quot;, by which they meant Menilek's demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three signatories jointly agreed, in Article 3, that in such an eventuality they would maintain a policy of neutrality, and refrain from military intervention, except to protect their legations and foreign nationals, and that not one of the three powers would take any military action in the country except in agreement with the other two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic Partition of the Country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure their respective interests they agreed, however, in Article 4, to partition the country into three spheres of influence. These were defined as a British, and Egyptian, interest in the Nile basin, and in particular in the regulation of the Nile waters; an Italian interest in the &quot;hinterland&quot; of the Italian colonies of Eritrea and Somalia, and in their linkage west of Addis Ababa; and a French interest in the &quot;hinterland&quot; of the French Somali Protectorate, and in the territory along which the railway from Addis Ababa to Jibuti was then already partially built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three signatories further agreed, in Article 10, that their representatives in Addis Ababa would keep each other mutually informed, and would cooperate in protecting their respective interests. If they were, for one reason or other, unable to do so, they were to inform their respective governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without Consulting the Emperor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This agreement was concluded, significantly enough, without consulting the Emperor. When he was afterwards presented with a copy he ironically thanked the representatives of the three powers for acquainting him with their governments' desire, as the treaty put it, to &quot;consolidate and maintain&quot; the independence of his realm. He observed, however, that the convention was &quot; subordinate&quot; to his authority, and could not 'in any way' bind his decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Interests of Whites against Blacks&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British representative in Addis Ababa, John Harrington, one of the drafters and keenest supporters of the convention, was insistent that he and his French and Italian colleagues should abide closely by it. He urged the Foreign Office, most forcefully, in February 1907, that all three representatives should receive &quot;strict orders to follow a policy in the interests of whites against blacks&quot;, and that if any of them were &quot;not in accord about any particular point, they should not disclose their difference of opinion to King Menelik, but refer the question to their respective Governments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klobukowski</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his displeasure with the Convention, Menilek entered into a Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with France, on 10 January 1908. Signed by Antony Klobukowski, the French Minister in Addis Ababa, and generally referred to by his name, it laid down, in Article 5, that Ethiopia had the right freely to import fire-arms. This important proviso was intended to legalise the entry of weapons through Jibuti and the French Somaliland Protectorate. Menilek in return accepted a measure of French extra-territorial privilege. Article 7 specified that French subjects in Ethiopia involved in legal cases had to be tried according to French law, and, if detained, placed in the custody of the French Consul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appointment of the First Ministers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failing health, the increasing complexity of government, the danger to national independence inherent in the Tripartite Convention, and the need to take account of the question of succession, caused the Emperor to decide on the establishment of the country's first cabinet. Established in October 1907 it consisted initially of nine trusted noblemen. They were respectively responsaible for justice, war, the interior, trade and foreign affairs, finance, agriculture, &quot;writing&quot;, i.e. of diplomatic correspondence and the royal chronicle, public works, and the palace. Their appointment stemmed, according to his chronicler, Gabra Sellas, Menilek's desire to &quot;implant European customs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menilek also attempted to solve the succession question more directly. By then largely incapacitated by several strokes, he took the decisive step of designating a successor in May 1909. In a remarkable proclamation he reminded his subjects of the political difficulties which had followed the deaths of his predecessors Twodros and Yohannes, and announced that his twelve-year-old grandson Lej Iyasu, the son of his daughter Shawaragga by Ras Mika'el, the Oromo and former Muslim ruler of Wallo, was his chosen heir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Iyasu's nomination as heir power was soon usurped by the dying monarch's formidable wife Empress Taytu, who claimed to be acting in accordance with her incapacitated husband's wishes. She succeeded in ousting some of her principal opponents, as well as in arranging a number of politically advantageous marriages. Her influence was, however, resented by many of the Shawan nobles, who feared that she, as a woman of Gondar, was bent on destroying their own political power. They rallied against her, and with the help of Abuna Matwos, and of the mahal safari, or palace guards, banished her from the capital. The government was then entrusted to one of Menilek's loyal chiefs, Ras Tassama Nadew. He was appointed as Lej Iyasu's regent, but soon afterwards fell ill, and died in April 1911. Two and a half years later Menilek himself finally passed away, on 13 December 1913.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the death of Ras Tassama the Council of Ministers proposed appointing a new regent, but Iyasu, who had begun to enjoy his freedom, refused to accept one. Brushing aside the Ministers, he impetuously declared, &quot;My father Menilek gave me a Regent, but God took him away!&quot; Thus asserting his independence, he took control of the government, and toured the country.  Returning to Addis Ababa he tried to remove his dying grandfather from the palace, but was prevented by the latter's wife, Taytu, and daughter, Zawditu, supported by the palace guards. When eventually Menilek died Iyasu insisted on keeping the news secret, and offended many of his subjects by forbidding public mourning. He later became increasingly disrespectful to Menilek's old nobles, and sneered at them that they had &quot;grown old, and fat&quot;. Not long after this he exiled both Taytu and Zawditu from the capital. The vested interests of Shawa retaliated by using his youth as a pretext for preventing him from being crowned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The works of 12 Ethiopian and Dutch artists are currently on exhibit at the Addis Ababa Fine Arts School until 15 February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition, 'Reality of Life' was opened Monday by Ambassador Jone Bos of the Netherlands, who noted that, &quot;the initiative goes back to a particular friendship between an Ethiopian and a Dutch artist, Ato Anteneh and Wim 't Mannetje. They met some years ago, both here and in Holland and they developed the idea of an exchange of works that were inspired by each other's thoughts about the other country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea was not dropped when the Dutch painter died but the Interchurch Organisation of Urk, a remarkable former island but now linked to the mainland of Holland, picked it up and supported it like they did in the 25 years of its life with many initiatives in Ethiopia. Being a typical fisherman's place they supported for example, the modernisation of fisheries in Tana Lake, but they did a lot more. The basic idea remained : to express what one thought about the other country!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What made the exhibition most interesting was not only did the Dutch paint their idea of Ethiopia and vice versa, but also that most paintings had the artist's explanations underneath. Anteneh Seyoum put under his 'Mr. Holland', &quot;Volume of my work is based on the life and the personality of Vincent Van Gogh, who is the real hero of Dutch artistic tradition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskender Seyoum on his part explained his 'Holland within my point of view' by saying, &quot;My main title is 'Holland within my point of view' at night. I try to represent the very hot and bright (shining) colours. I don't know, maybe it could be cold in Holland and full of grey colours, anyhow either bright colours or cold, in the future I will use the real one when I get the chance to visit your country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilma Klaver in her 'Contemplate if you will' says, &quot;Oddly enough I could, in the place where I live, find totally nothing about Ethiopia in the library.  I could find something about Africa in general but not about this country specific. That's why I will make a painting which springs from my fantasy, fed by a few vague things which I once heard about this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Jacoba Schroevers-- the only one of the Dutch artists present in this country at the moment--out it in her 'Confrontation', &quot;The exchange of arts is important to bring the people together. In my opinion all the people on earth are valuable. We may learn a lot of each other as long as we accept everybody as he is. We can learn of each other's cultures, faiths, the way we are and no domination, exploitation or manipulation takes place. Only then a good interaction may be effected, which will lead to understanding, peace on earth and a good existence for everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - An exhibition of crafts from southern Ethiopia opened at Asni Arts Veranda 17 January with a lecture by Dr. Alula Pankhurst who led a reasearch team of twelve students from the Addis Ababa University. The exhibition, lasting until 8 February, featured traditionally made baskets, musical instruments, hunting weapons, pottery, and woodworks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, these highly skilled artisans are the poorest of the population, living a life of isolation, and considered 'impure and polluting'. &quot; Traditionally,&quot; explained Dr. Pankhurst, &quot;most of them have been despised and kept apart from the rest of society, being denied access to land and livestock and restricted to their craft and forging activities.&quot; He noted that after the 1974 revolution, the status of these people seemed to improve, &quot;some gained status through religious conversion, notably to evangelical churches; others were successful as traders or urban migrants, in particular the weavers.&quot; Unfortunately, the old prejudices have resurfaced, and,&quot; there are accounts of artisans losing their land and being forced to migrate to look for work,&quot; he remarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research project was funded by OXFAM and NOVIS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The two companies are currently in Ethiopia to sell their planes to the national carrier</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media inched their way through numerous body-checks Tuesday on their way to the tarmac at the Bole International Airport to see the Airbus Industrie introduce its biggest airplane-- the A340. According to Mr. Alain Dupiech, manager of press relations, this was the first time a plane of this size--it seats from 250 to 350--has landed in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as testing the plane's performance in a high altitude, Airbus will be presenting the A340 to Ethiopian Airlines. Traditionally, ETHIOPIAN has dealt with American based Boeing, but former secretary of state Warren Christopher's tour of the airline during his visit to Ethiopia last October, has led to speculation that the relationship might be faltering. Airbus Industrie -- the European aircraft manufacturing consortium co-owned by Germany, France, Britain, and Spain--has been negotiating with ETHIOPIAN for the past two years, said Dupiech.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claiming the highest safety record in the industry--only six crashes during its twenty-five years operation--Airbus is eating into the older Boeing's lead with 38-42% of the market at present. The industry is a lucurative business, worth between 200-250 million USD. Ask them why they change from Boeing after many years of association, Dupiech challenged the press, going on to list the four-engine A340's edge over its competitors. It has the 'quietest cabin in the sky' is fuel efficient, environmentally friendly, and provides 'unrivaled profit potential for non-stop long range operations on routes with medium passenger demand, as well as the ability to increase flight frequencies on other more heavily traveled services', according to an Airbus press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This confidence seems to be shared by Ed. Strongman, engineering test pilot, who had a chance to assess other manufacturer's products when he worked for the aviation authority in the UK. As Strongman--who was last here the day the 1974 revolution broke-out--indicated, flying with Airbus insures that he has the best technology at his disposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airbus' arrival in Addis Ababa coincides with Boeing's presentation of its proposal to the ETHIOPIAN management. ETHIOPIAN board chairman Siye Abraha and other members of ETHIOPIA's management including the general manager, Dr.  Ahmed Kellow have been to see the A340. According to sources, the national carrier is expected to purchase upto four airplanes as it extends its flight to North America and Japan. Airbus has stated its willingness to lease planes to ETHIOPIAN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether ETHIOPIAN buys from Airbus or not, the latter has certainly made its presence known to everybody with the whole press according it front page coverage. A lavish cocktail reception, attended by French Ambassador Mr.  Alain Rouquie, German Ambassador Mrs. Wiltrud Holk, and Mr. Karl Harbo, head of the European delegates presented a united front for the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the time of the previous government, Boeing supplied ETHIOPIAN with credit to purchase its fleet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In the past week, we had quite a flood of economic news.  Fertilizer subsidies financed from the government budget have been discontinued since January 9, 1997 (&quot;Addis Zemen&quot;, Tir 11, 1989 E.C.). The Ethiopian Investment Authority (EIA) announced that fifty-two investors were granted land in Addis Ababa outside the government's land-lease system (&quot; Addis Zemen&quot; Tir 11, 1989 E.C.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Executive Director of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is scheduled to pay a three-day visit to Ethiopia (&quot;The Ethiopian Herald&quot;, January 14, 1997). Farmers' cooperatives are to receive loans from the Development Bank of Ethiopia without collateral requirements (&quot;Addis Zemen&quot;, Tir 10, 1989 E.C.). It was also announced that Ethiopia's main (Meher) harvest in 1996 was 11.7 million MT (&quot;The Ethiopian Herald,&quot; January 18, 1997).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, the cessation of fertilizer subsidies is bad news for farmers, but good news for the IMF, which has been pressing the government for just such a move. Taxpayers will hardly feel the difference. On the other hand, farmers will have to pay the full price of 250 birr per quintal for DAP and 240 birr for UREA as against the subsidized previous prices of 200 birr and 190 birr, respectively. On its part the government would save 160-178 million birr in the 1996/97 crop year. Although the government has terminated fertilizer subsidies, it intends to continue fixing wholesale fertilizer prices, leaving retail prices to the forces of supply and demand. Why the workings of the market are confined to only retail pricing and why the government does not fully disengage from price fixing are questions that remain unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of the cessation of fertilizer subsidies are difficult to gauge at this early stage. Would it cause a cutback on fertilizer use or force farmers to mark up their crop selling prices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased fertilizer use appears to be something of a mixed blessing, because while yields obviously increase, the downward impact on produce prices has definitely been unwelcome. As the farmers' leeway on produce prices is thus limited, the only choice they would have would probably be to cut back on fertilizer use, which would be bad for overall agricultural production. All the same, the government's decision to end fertilizer subsides should be regarded as a step in the right direction as subsidies run counter to the principle of efficency in resource utilization through artificial underpricing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most dramatic economic news to have come out in the past week was the announcement by the EIA that a substantial amount of land was being granted to investors in Addis Ababa outside the government's highly controversial land-lease mechanism. No better proof could be found of the government's own doubts about the rightness of its own land policy. We have repeatedly argued in the past that a land policy which restricts ownership to the state and which insists unto death on an extremely sluggish land distribution system based on leasehold by auction is a veritable stranglehold on economic growth. It seems now that the pressures of economic momentum are beginning to break asunder an artificial barrier that should never have been there in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as always, when man-made laws are overtaken by events, the need to put the reins back on becomes an unavoidable preoccupation. Actually, granting land outside the land-lease mechanism, which is the only legal way the government has instituted, is tantamount to an infringement of the law. By which law and according to which specific rules, regulations and procedures is land being handed out to potential users outside the land-lease systems?  Are we now entering a periods of chaos on the issue of land distribution?  What guarantees are there that government officials are not handing out land to people on the basis of the oppositeness of their gender and the fatness of their wallets? Putting the land-lease law in mothballs is good news, but operating without a substitute law would be equivalent to opening the floodgates of corruption wide open!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the news in the past week was the scheduled visit by the Executive Director of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. No doubt this would be a great honour for all those Ethiopian professionals engaged in implementing the government's population policy, which is understandably still a long way from showing its first signs of reducing Ethiopia's extremely high average fertility of nearly 8 children per woman. There is not an iota of doubt that excessive population growth in Ethiopia is a major problem. The nutrition standards of the population are going downhill as could be appreciated from the pitiable height, weight and skin tone of the average Ethiopian. Children are not as lovable as they used to be, now posing not an inconsiderable menace in the streets. Above all and somewhat paradoxically, burial places are in extremely short supply with tales of fees running into thousands of birr for choice burial spots! Not even the merciless juggernaut of death could dampen the prolificity of copulation! It would not be in bad taste to quote at this point what a certain cynic, Ethiopian by nationality, said in connection with the population explosion in the country: &quot;Thank you for smoking, because you are contributing to increasing the death rate&quot;. Well, well, what do you say to that!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now on to the other two bits of economic news: the one about the plan by the DBE to grant loans to farmers' cooperatives without collateral and the other about the estimate of the &quot;Meher&quot; crop production. Regarding the first one, the appropriate question would be: is the DBE planning to give such credits of its own free will or is the government arm-twisting it do so? If the DBE is going to extend the loans of its own accord, considering the move a profitable activity, nobody should stop it from going right ahead with its plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the DBE should remember that a government bail-out such as the one it received sometime in late 1994 would not be forthcoming should its plan to engage in cooperative credit extension without collateral negatively affects the quality of its asset portfolio. Concerning the estimate for the 1996 &quot; Meher&quot; crop production, the 11.7 million metric tons of 117 million quintals given by the FAO/WFP Crop and Supply Assessment Mission represents a significant departure from the historical statistical trend observed in crop production figures issued by the Central Statistics Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, for example, are CSA's estimates for the production of major crops in Ethiopia in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1990/91 66 million quintals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1991/92 52 million quintals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1992/93 not available</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1993/94 70 million quintals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could agricultural production increase by more than 67 percent in a matter of only about two years in the Ethiopian development context? Wouldn't this call the reliability of the estimates into serious question?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assessment Mission also assigned the following percentages to the factors contributing to the increase in agricultural production:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good weather conditions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">50 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased acreage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's agri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">extension programme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The percentage attributed to the government agricultural extension programme in the increase in agricultural production appears to be on the high side, considering the relatively short period the programme has been in operation and its limited coverage of the farm population. At any rate, the Mission's growth attribution exercise still indicates the high degree of vulnerability of Ethiopian rain-fed agriculture to the vicissitudes of the weather.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In an exclusive interview with Addis Tribune last month, Dr.  Abdulmejid Hussien, Minister of Transport and Communication observed that, &quot; During the last 100 years, only 150,000 lines have been installed. This is a shame for an institution which is considered to be one of the oldest in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, it is envisaged that within the next five years, this country will have an additional half-million telephone lines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on to add that cellular phones will soon be installed throughout the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks were followed closely by many Ethiopians, especially Dr. Feseha Mekuria, senior staff engineer for Ericsson-- said to be one of the three top firms in the world engaged in communication technology. To achieve the minister's goal for the next five years, Dr. Feseha reckons that it would take more than five years. Probably ten years. &quot;But if we use the new technology--the new wireless technology,&quot; he noted, &quot;we could do this type of subscriber connection very fast. It doesn't need so much maintenance as we have it for wire networks.&quot; Though officially on holiday, Dr. Feseha is very eager to get to work discussing the system with concerned ministries before returning to Sweden. According to him, Ericsson is not really trying to penetrate a new market, but rather re-establishing old links. &quot;Actually,&quot; he explained, &quot;Ericsson used to be the supplier company during Haile Selassie's time. I've seen old Ericsson telephones in several homes here in Ethiopia.  They are supposed to be also the people who built the first local telephone exchange in Ethiopia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Axum in 1962, the seventh out of ten children, Dr. Feseha grew up with the desire to become just like his elder brother who had died during the trouble after the 1974 revolution. &quot;He studied electrical engineering and I had the books he had bought while he was a student.&quot; With a burning ambition and the grades to match, in 1980, he got a Water Resources Authority scholarship to India to study civil engineering. As soon as he got to India though, he managed to convince the university authorities that it would be better if he took electrical engineering instead. &quot;Since I went to a vocational school, the Asfawossen, I had taken electrical engineering, otherwise I would not have been able to change from the civil engineering course Water Resources wanted to give.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of 1984, he graduated with a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Autumadras Building and Engineering College.  &quot;The curriculum was the same&quot; recalls Dr. Feseha, but, &quot; when you have millions of students competing to come to the university, it was tough for us to go there and compete with the Indian students. We showed also that our high school status was very good.&quot; But first, the Ethiopian students had to be shocked out of their complacency. &quot;It was during our first exams. We noticed that while we were writing short answers, the Indian students were asking for extra answer sheets. We were so surprised and many of us were disappointed that we couldn't do just as well.&quot; With a few extra lessons, though, the Ethiopians managed to even come first in their section, Dr.  Feseha is proud to say. One of the minor disappointments of his stay in India, remains that he was not able to learn the local language. &quot;It was a very difficult language to pick up, and the students wanted to speak only in English. There was also no initiative from the university. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Feseha stayed some six months in India after graduation, deciding that he did not as yet want to come back to Ethiopia, but would look for schools to do post graduate studies. It was not, however, the United States that he finally went to--as he had planned -- but to Sweden where his wife was studying. When he arrived there, he got another 'shock'. In India, there were people in the streets at all times of the day, he said, but in Sweden it was very quiet. &quot; It was a well built city, but very quiet. I thought at first that there was some kind of restriction&quot; he mused. Dr. Feseha was able to learn the language after six months of intensive training, and get on with his studies which required him to teach at the university (University of Linkoping). In 1989, Dr. Feseha got his Technology Licensiate (a degree between a Masters and a Ph.D.). For his Ph.D., he focused on applications for speech communication. In 1993, he took his Ph.D.. in applied electronics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 he joined Ericsson and was last year promoted to his present post of senior staff engineer. &quot;The challenge is&quot; Dr. Feseha explained of his new found passion, &quot;to push the technology to its limits. How to make the mobile telephone more user friendly, for example to see the person you talk to on the phone. At the same time there is the basic application for developing countries-- how to make this highly developed mobile technology available to developing countries at low cost. That is also one of my challenges. Telecom.  structure is a key factor in many developing countries for their socio- economic development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Feseha is not however, blind to the problems posed by inadequate administration. &quot;The greatest problem in developing countries remains bureaucracy, and lack of trained manpower,&quot; he said, adding that he hoped that in this country there was &quot;a much more determined kind of vision to improve the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Feseha Mekuria is married and has two daughters. He is a member of the International Electronics and Electronics Engineers society, and the European Speech Communication Association. &quot;I try to play basketball,&quot; he said, &quot;but most of my free time is spent driving my young daughters to places they want to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Our Staff Reporter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from the Ethiopian Fertilizer Industry Agency said 18 January that as of this month, the government will end subsidizing fertilizers as it has been doing so for the past four years. According to ENA, only wholesale price of fertilizers will continue to be regulated at the national level, leaving dealers to 'benefit from the competition in distributing the input'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indicating that that the change in policy was necessitated because the practice was doing little to help the national economic development, the agency admitted that the 338 million birr the government spent for subsidy and extension programs in the past two years, could have built 1,126 schools.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With few exceptions, most of the business in Addis Ababa doesn't pay sufficient attention to customers. Even in a highly placed industry as banks, insurance and hotels &quot;customer satisfaction&quot; is not a top priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quality products and quality service are in demand. Customers are literally begging to be served in many places. Courtesy and smiles are rare. The success and failure of many enterprises as we may see in the next few years will be determined by &quot;customer satisfaction.&quot; A business enterprise that does not focus on customer satisfaction will not even qualify for the finals in world class competition, despite its attention to price and cost reduction, technology, product quality, or all three put together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As management experts would tell us, customer satisfaction is but a milestone on the long, hard road to customer loyalty and lifelong retention.  It is about time the business community in this country get involved to set up a Customer-Oriented Culture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Pinheiro will be meeting with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and other government officials to discuss future relations between Europe and Africa. On his last day in the country, Professor Pinheiro and the Ethiopian government will sign the National Indicative Programme (NIP) covering a five- year period. The fund, 370 million USD or approximately 2.4 billion birr, was made available to the country under the Revised Lome IV Convention signed in Mauritius 4 November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Professor Pinheiro will sign with neighbouring East African government officials, a Regional Indicative Programme (RIP) worth over 240 USD. According to Mr. Harbo, the largest portion of its regional fund is at present going to a telecommunication programme for Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia joined the ACP countries in 1976, receiving a total of over 1628 million USD during these years under Stabex from the European Investment Bank, from the regional section of the European Development Fund, and other instruments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On their way to Morocco for a crucial African Cup of Nations qualification match, sixteen members of Ethiopia's national soccer team have decided to stay in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a case of 'now-you-see-them, now-you-don't' as even Italian police had no idea of the players whereabouts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it has become clear that the 16 wish to gain asylum in Italy due to political differences. The remaining members returned to Addis Ababa Thursday 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time there has been such an occurance involving the national soccer team. Three years ago, 6 players abandoned the team in Morocco. There is no doubt that this is a very serious blow to Ethiopian football and the shock waves are beginning to be felt. Not only is it a great loss for the National side, the team also contained numerous top players from league clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer players are not the only ones to be lured into leaving their country to see what awaits. Boxers and athletes have recently 'missed' the plane home from high-level sports meetings. There has been no word on what the fate of the 16 will be, nor there been has any statement by the football federation here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the motives behind the athlete's risky decision, the fact remains that Ethiopia has lost a number of top-level players and the side will now have to start from scratch. It appears that the Ethiopian Football Federation would welcome more than just the return of the Axum obelisk from Italy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - It may sound incredible, but we are already almost seven months into the current fiscal year of 1996/97, which means some 60 percent of the budget year has already elapsed. Time does fly, doesn't it? At any rate this is an appropriate time for a mid-year assessment of how the nation's economy is doing, but unfortunately the relevant statistics are either altogether unavailable or, if available are inadequate and not up-to- date enough. For example, the following data as of at least November 1996 would have been highly enlightening if they were available:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*coffee production</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*industrial production</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*estimates of retail sales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*housing starts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*exports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*imports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*government current and capital expenditure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*estimates of government investment and domestic and foreign private investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*total numbers of new jobs created</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*major public and private investment projects implemented What kind of a bureaucracy do we have? It can't produce even very basic data on the economy which are fairly reliable and up-to-date? Why should taxpayers foot its wage bill? For a mid-year assessment, such essential economic data should as a matter of statistical routine, generally be placed on the desks of policymakers by about the middle of February.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These need not be final figures, but need only be reliable estimates.  However, there seems to be no such statistical tradition, and statistics are usually put together on an ad hoc basis at the last minute when some bigwig suddenly realizes that he needs such basic data to make the decision he is about to make or, as is often the case, he has already made privately. How can any major or even minor decision be made without sufficient information?  How can any respectable judgment be formed about the economy or any other matter without recourse to the relevant information? On top of all this, there is the problem of &quot;doctoring&quot; or &quot;massaging&quot; official economic statistics so that they put the performance of the national economy in a good light! This only makes matters even worse. Reliable information is to decision-making as unpolluted air is to the lungs!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for the diatribe and exhortation. Now, let us try to assess the current Ethiopian macroeconomy on the basis of what little relatively up-to- date economic data we have been able to lay our hands on. The Central Statistical Authority (CSA) says that the rate of inflation in the country in November 1996 (the latest figure available at the time of writing) was lower by 6.5 percent than what it was in November 1995. So, during the first five months of the current fiscal year of 1996/97, we are officially being told that the term to use in connection with the movement of domestic prices is not the usual &quot;inflation&quot; but rather its opposite &quot;deflation&quot;. Do you agree or not? Voices of protest such as the following may be heard:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*What about the astronomical rent increases on government-owned houses in August 1996?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Are the fuel price increases made in September 1996 peanuts? If so, for whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Are the prices of land, houses and used cars included in the price indicator?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*There is not much of a decrease in the price of &quot;teff&quot; per quintal, nor in cooking oil per liter and butter per kilo. Teff is currently selling at over 280 birr per quintal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Have any of the statistical boffins at the CSA taken into account the price rises in water, electricity and telephone services charges in their esteemed calculations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*At the restaurant where I take my lunch, I have seen with my own two eyes the price of a dish going up from seven birr to twelve birr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*My statistical literacy is not that much, but I do read the government- owned Amharic daily &quot;Addis Zemen&quot;, and only the other day the newspaper was saying that the prices of domestically produced pharmaceuticals were skyrocketing (&quot;Addis Zemen&quot;, Tir 4, 1989 E.C).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*Orange prices are going up to 3.50 birr per kilo on the private market.  Has that been factored into your price calculations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistical wizards at the CSA may understandably feel a little irritated at this point and reply:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not responsible for your lack of statistical literacy. If you don't know a mode from a median or statistics as a science from statistics as a set of data, we would advise you to buy one of the statistics books entitled &quot; Statistics Made Easy&quot;. As for your comments, we do have some explanations to provide. First, house rent is not included in the index. So, your objections concerning rising house rents are well taken, but these are just not shown in our index. The other thing you must remember is that our price index is supposed to capture price movements both upwards and downwards. Hence, what you observe in the general index is the net outcome on those positive and negative movements. In any case, although what you say may be true when taken in isolation, in general it is quite difficult to deny the fact that there has at least been price stability on average in recent months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, well, you are up against the experts: What can one say, on matters statistical, against the masters of stochastic regression models, analysis of variance, homoscedasticity, autocorrelation and multicollinearity!? But who is going to be browbeaten into silence by those tongue-twisters!? They had better put them back in their statistics or econometrics text books! What we are telling them is the exact bills we paid at supermarkets and restaurants the other day!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, let us move quickly to the other experts, the monetary economists.  These breeds of experts seem to be careful with the statistics they spew, perhaps because they are dealing with money. They say, officially, that what they call broad money (currency outside bank demand, savings and time deposits) rose by 11.7 percent in November 1996 (again the latest figure available as we go to press) when compared to the level in November 1995. An increase in the total volume of money of that magnitude would normally be expected to show up as price inflation, because as monetarists are wont to say, &quot;inflation is a monetary phenomenon&quot;. But, alas, the stochastic nature of economic variables in Ethiopia is such as to defy any such neat economic principle. As we have tried to indicate, what actually transpired on the price front during that period was not inflation but rather deflation.  However, during the first five months of the 1996/97 fiscal year, broad money increased by only 1.5 percent, lending some credence to the famous monetarist tenet of inflation being largely determined by the magnitude of monetary expansion. One point five percent is not much of an increase. The official reason given for the overall decline in domestic prices are: the bumper harvest in 1995/96 (remember the all-time high of 96 million quintals?), and the reduction in customs duties, pushing domestic prices of imports downwards despite exchange rate depreciation. &quot;If you don't agree, you are perfectly entitled to your opinion&quot;, say government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the country's foreign exchange reserves, whose level is an important indicator of the health of the nation's macroeconomy, we observe that things are not as good as they appear to be on the price front. During the first five months of the current fiscal year of 1996/97, foreign reserves went down from 6.2 billion birr to 5.6 billion birr or by about 10.7 percent.  As would be expected, the collapse of coffee prices on the world market from peak levels in 1994/95 was an important contributing factor here. Trends in other economic variables are briefly as given below, although figures available are not up-to-date and cover for the most part only the first three months of the current fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Value of Exports: unfavorable, dropped by over 30 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coffee export unit price: went down by 27 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imports: down by 44 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exchange rate: the birr depreciated marginally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should we make of the overall macroeconomics picture during the first five months of the current fiscal year of 1996/97 on the basis of the above official statistics? Well, they say inflation is down. That remains a big question mark. Monetary expansion appears to be slowing down, which is good for price stability, but is also a sign of recession. Foreign reserves are down by over ten percent; world coffee prices are still depressed. So, overall Ethiopia's macroeconomy during the first five months of the current fiscal year looks like being anything but buoyant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUTARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - What started as a way of survival, during the great drought of 1992, has developed into a full-blown taste for the 8,000 baboons roaming Zimbabwe's precious timber plantations in the eastern Manicaland province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simians are stripping the bark of young wattle and pine trees at an alarming rate causing damage to the plantations in excess of five million U.S.  dollars every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baboons, whose natural diet includes a variety of plants and animals such as small mammals, birds, eggs, insects, slugs and small reptiles, were forced into chewing the bark of young commercial trees in the plantations when their diet was not readily available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the drought, they developed a taste -- and a sport -- for the bark in the plantations, leaving investors and conservationists scratching their heads as to how to deal with what has become an &quot;expensive nuisance.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grotesque-faced but highly intelligent simians target trees between eight years and 10 years old, strip the bark off the branches or, in some cases, strip off the whole tree of its bark and leave it to die, worthless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes a tree 25 years to mature and get maximum commercial value. Now, the three major timber companies which own 80 percent of the country's 110, 700 hectares of commercial plantations are spending millions of dollars trying to replace damaged trees by replanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates are that in most plantations the baboons have destroyed up to 3 percent of the trees to a level beyond commercial utilization. One company has lost at least 600 hectares of trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baboons are a menace, especially when two troops meet and engage in a contest of stripping the bark off the trees, causing extensive damage in their new-found sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timber industry, whose major stakeholders in the province and the country as a whole are the Wattle Company, Border Timbers and the state-owned Forestry Commission, has been hit hard by the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The baboons have, for a long time, been notorious for being a problem animal in the rural areas where they steal poultry, raid crops or snatch groceries from children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people say that baboons have taken to this kind of behavior because man has been collecting wild fruits for sale in towns, leaving the primates with insufficient food. However, others contend that there is enough wild fruit, only that the animals have developed bad habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the timber companies, the problem is growing along with the baboon population. Females give birth to one young at a time after a gestation period of seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timber industry says it has reached a point where it has to deal with the animals to avoid further losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry, which in 1996 produced at least 120 million dollars worth of timber goods, has suggested birth control measures to stabilize the baboon population. Other strategies such as culling or hounding them out of the plantations have also been proffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the idea of killing this human-like animal has met with resistance from traditional leaders and environmentalists. Traditional leaders say that African customs forbid the wholesale killing of baboons, because doing so could cast a disastrous spell, such as perennial droughts, on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists say that the culling of the animals could disturb the ecological balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those bearing the brunt of the problem think otherwise. So, the battle lines are drawn between humans even before the fight is taken to the baboons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is currently losing millions due to the big baboon population that we have in the forests and we have no choice but to look at ways of how we can prevent them from destroying the trees,&quot; says Edward Mutsvairo, the Forestry Commission acting general manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wattle company's operations manager, Nigel Payne, says: &quot;The baboons seem to have quite a taste in pine bark and they have become a pest causing a lot of damage and losses to the industry as they have moved from their traditional food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the rapid growth in the baboon population could also be attributed to the lack of a natural predator, such as the leopard, in the forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paynes says contraception would fail in the short-term, as an immediate solution was to arrest the losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea of contraception sounds good on paper but practically it would be something else so we need to reduce the population first and then think of long term strategies latter,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive officer of the Timber Producers Federation, Bill Johnstone, thinks the baboons have just developed a hedonist habit, like smoking, of destroying the trees not because they want food but because they just love the fun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem has been in existence before with only minor cases being recorded,&quot; he says. &quot;But today, the problem has reached extremely serious proportions and if not controlled will endanger the future of the timber industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various ways, such as trappings, have been explored, he says, but the baboons learn quickly and know how to avoid the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sharp increase in the baboon population has also been attributed to the lack of proper control by the Problem Animal Control Section, a unit within the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management, which used to control the animals by using a very poisonous chemical known as Teladrex to kill them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use of the chemical was then banned worldwide in the 1980's resulting in the rapid population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnstone thinks the baboon problem can only be dealt with after a short- term method has been introduced first. So, the industry is trying to get help from countries Kenya, and Sweden which have experienced the same problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sweden, the clever animals were conquered by spraying of wolves' urine in timber plantations to scare them away as they do not stay anywhere near danger signals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the industry's survival we have to reduce the baboons immediately then we can start talking about long-term solutions which would have to be environmental friendly,&quot; Johnstone says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - African newspapers commented at length on the bombings in Algeria, Zaire's military counteroffensive against anti- government forces, student demonstrations in Cote d'Ivoire, the suspension of Bingu Wa Mutharika, the secretary-general of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the state of the continent's universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan, Algeria has been hit by bombings not experienced since the end of its war of independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronted with this, the country's papers said, government has remained incredibly mute. The papers asked many unanswered questions, which seemed to highlight their frustration at official silence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Watan wondered why it had been so easy for the bombers to set off their devices in this &quot;very well guarded&quot; capital of three million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why such ease of action?&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Khabar could not fathom what the bombers wanted to prove by destroying everything in sight, while Liberte wondered where the bombs had come from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to unconfirmed reports,&quot; it said, &quot;between three thousand and four thousand tons of explosives have been stolen from warehouses in the last two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each day,&quot; Liberte said, &quot;demolition experts defuse these bombs.&quot; But more importantly, it said, &quot;who are the masterminds behind these attacks?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press also asked what game the government was playing since, Le Matin said, it had maintained an &quot;irresponsible silence&quot; throughout the entire affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Zaire military gears up for its counteroffensive in the east of the country, two of Dakar's newspapers commented on the state of the army and its preparations for battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Soleil said that if Kinshasa failed to defeat the anti-government forces, then &quot;the most serious threat&quot; to Zaire would be to keep the country as one entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is the Zairean army not a reflection of a government nearing its end, as many observers think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it not a reflection of a government that finds it hard to identify with anything but power?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Laurent-Desire Kabila's resounding victory is an answer to all these questions, so too is the time it has taken the central government to retaliate,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is certainly this (government) reaction which will help us gauge the real situation Zaire,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the police shooting of university students in Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday, Sud Quotidien said that the government's decision to use force appeared more like a &quot;declaration of war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action, it said, showed that African governments &quot;still have a lot to learn&quot; about managing social conflicts, especially student demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government authority is not judged by its ability to deploy security forces at the slightest sign of social tension. Rather, it lies in its ability to make timely concessions without appearing to concede defeat,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It warned that the hardening of attitudes was dangerous because it could so easily lead to an escalation of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today only one student has died but clashes tomorrow will cause new victims and the cycle will continue,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka dailies commented on the suspension of Bingu wa Mutharika as secretary-general of COMESA, following anonymous accusations of his misuse of the organization's resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council of Ministers of the COMESA suspended him for three months and ordered him before them for a hearing. Mutharika refused, saying the ministers were not authorized for this sort of thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post said that there may have been &quot;valid reasons&quot; for Mutharika's suspension &quot;but the Council of Ministers should have been extra careful to avoid even a hint that the action was dictated by the exigencies of internal Malawian politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It failed in this respect,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Zambia Daily Mail said because Mutharika -- a Malawian -- is a public servant heading an organization funded by tax payers money of member states, &quot;he should feel duty-bound to open himself up to an inquiry, whether he believes it is a kangaroo court or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Council of Ministers, on the other hand, should give the accused...the opportunity to respond to the charges levelled against him,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's Daily Times, published in Lagos, stayed with the problems of African universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that the Association of African Universities, which met recently in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, &quot;needed to re-examine closely&quot; the role of the continent's universities &quot;with a view to making them more relevant to their societies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, it noted, had been the case elsewhere in the world, with the results of their research efforts benefitting their public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The secret of their success has to do with how well they have been able to impact upon their host communities,&quot; it said,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African universities, which were established with similar ideals, it said, had for the most part failed to live up to their billing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than provide a strong basis for development, they are becoming a perpetual liability to the governments,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This state of affairs has created many problems in its wake: the dwindling resources to universities has kept the remuneration of university teachers, as well as non academic staff very low; and led to the loss of highly skilled manpower to foreign institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has also ensured a continuous dearth of lecturers and facilities, and a consequent fall in academic standards,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the 21st century beckons, the Lusaka delegates have the onerous responsibility to come up with workable proposals to make universities in Africa more responsive to the needs of their environment,&quot; it added. &quot;A situation where many centers of excellence spend far more of their meagre resources on housing, transportation and other services is unhelpful. They should think of new ways of better managing their funds. Like their counterparts in other parts of the world, they should learn to spend more on research activities which should be the fulcrum of academia,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - African governments were urged Friday to formulate comprehensive adolescent reproductive health policies which recognize the rights of youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of their recommendations at the end of the Forum on Adolescent Reproductive Health, delegates said that these policies should be developed with the participation of the concerned age groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of the forum was on preparing African youth for the next millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum's 500 delegates also urged regional groups to &quot;support and encourage appropriate adolescent reproductive health programmes and services, particularly among sexually active adolescents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They asked the Organization of African Unity, the continent's most important political body, and other regional groups, to try and influence governments to promoting adolescent reproductive health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closing the forum, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, Nafis Sadik, said she was concerned at the persistence of harmful practices such as female circumcision, which is practiced in 26 of Africa's 53 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some one hundred and twenty million women worldwide have suffered female genital mutilation. This is a painful and unnecessary procedure,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Sadik said that some countries had started looking for alternatives to female circumcision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, she said that parents had a key role in shaping their adolescents' reproductive health by giving them correct education and advise on sexuality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of comments by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns issued January 23 on Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is profoundly worried by signs that the conflict in Zaire may soon escalate. Increased combat in Eastern Zaire would not only threaten the civilian population in the area -- including the internally displaced and remaining Rwandan refugees -- but also risk a direct confrontation among national armies in the region. We renew our call for an immediate cease-fire and dialogue among belligerents to achieve a peaceful political settlement of the crisis. We also call for withdrawal of any foreign forces -- including mercenaries -- currently in Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start of this crisis, we have urged neighboring governments not to join the conflict, and have pressed them to use their influence to restrain the rebel forces operating in the Kivus. The United States strongly reaffirms its recognition of the territorial integrity of Zaire and the inviolability of the existing borders of all states in the region. This stance is consistent with declarations of African regional leaders at the November 5 Nairobi summit and in U.N. Resolution 1078 of November 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To bring a lasting end to this crisis, a political settlement is needed not only among Zaire and neighboring countries, but also between the authorities in Kinshasa and disaffected groups in the east. We and other members of the international community will continue to work closely in support of African peacemaking initiatives, which have included the regional summit meetings convened by Kenyan President Moi and a meeting of the U.N.'s Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa hosted by Congolese President Lissouba. As a further step to promote a peaceful settlement, the imminent appointment of a U.N. Special Representative to the Great Lakes region is a welcome development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While an end to the fighting in Eastern Zaire is an urgent objective, Zairians must also continue to focus on the preeminent goal of their democratic transition. Establishment of credible governing institutions is essential to provide for stability and return to economic development in Zaire. Moreover, popular participation in selecting political leaders and greater decentralization of authority to the regions hold the keys to addressing the demands of disaffected groups in Eastern Zaire and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - There have been conflicting reports on the number of people killed in the Rwandan army's clean-up operation in the northwest of the country following increasing violence in the region. Speaking on the BBC yesterday, Vice-President Paul Kagame said 80 people had been killed, including civilians, but NGO sources have spoken of hundreds of deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers from the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (UNHRFOR) are currently visiting the communes to establish the extent of the sweep.  Kagame's adviser Claude Dusaidi, in an interview with the BBC, said violence had intensified since the mass return of refugees to the country. The government was mobilising the people politically, he said, and military vigilance was being increased. Dusaidi denied reports that two of three people, taken into custody in connection with the killing of three Spanish Medicos del Mundo (MDM) employees in Ruhengeri, had died. In further remarks, broadcast by Rwandan radio yesterday, Dusaidi also categorically denied allegations that the Rwandan army was involved in the deaths of the aid workers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan radio yesterday reported that two genocide suspects had committed suicide in Gisenyi prison. It named the two as ex-FAR soldiers Lt.Col Nzabanita and Lt.Innocent Nsabimana. They apparently used their clothes to strangle themselves while in a latrine on Tuesday. Their deaths were discovered after the prison guard went to investigate why they were spending so long in the latrine. A probe into their suspected involvement in the 1994 genocide was underway, the radio said. In a separate despatch, the radio said an ex-FAR major, his six children and a neighbour were killed on Wednesday in the Nyamyumba commune of Gisenyi prefecture. An investigation was being held into the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Rwandan authorities launched their crackdown on Hutu extremists, army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro briefed the international community in Kigali on the measures currently underway. He said the number of soldiers in the area had been increased and patrols were working round the clock. Civilians had also been urged to cooperate with the military. &quot;We assure you that we shall deal with this problem and...bring back the confidence you've had in us, &quot; he stated. A report by Amnesty International meanwhile, released today, warned that the &quot;rushed and forced nature&quot; of refugee returns could lead to increased human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The long-expected Zairean counter-offensive appears to be underway, with reports yesterday of the capture of Walikale from rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL). The Zairean defence ministry announced that 100 rebels, including one of their leaders, were killed in the fighting, with 20 soldiers wounded on the government side.  According to the statement, Zairean forces (FAZ) used air cover to deal a &quot; deadly blow to the enemy&quot;. Gabonese Africa No.1 radio, in a broadcast from Kinshasa, said FAZ troops were now heading for Bukavu and Goma. It quoted a FAZ communique as calling on people to vacate the battle zones. &quot;The counter- offensive will not spare anybody, and the war will be fought to the end, whatever the price,&quot; the statement said. Sources in Kisangani told AFP late yesterday that Zairean helicopter gunships staged raids on rebel supply lines near Walikale, destroying several trucks carrying ammunition to the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the widely-reported presence of foreign mercenaries in eastern Zaire, the French daily 'Liberation' today alleged a Belgian was heading a force of 280 white mercenaries in Kisangani to fight alongside Zairean troops. The paper's correspondent in Kisangani said the Belgian, named Christian Tavernier, was a friend of French mercenary Bob Denard, and had been in touch with advisers of President Jacques Chirac, as well as with President Mobutu. The paper said Tavernier, described as in his sixties, had set up base at Watsa, a mining town 700km northeast of Kisangani. The mercenary force allegedly financed by Kuwait, included Serbs, Croats, Russians, Poles, Belgians, Italians and a &quot;significant number of French&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking ahead of the reported capture of Walikale, Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila had urged Goma residents to stop panicking over Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo's announcement on Monday of a major counter-offensive in the east. &quot;It seems people in Kinshasa will counter-attack, but why are you running away,&quot; Kabila told a news conference in Goma on Tuesday. However some aid agencies in north and south Kivu have begun scaling down their operations and some western embassies called on relief organisations to pull out altogether. Aid sources in Goma say the rebels have been requisitioning aid vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people trapped in eastern Zaire will be the worst-affected victims of a Zairean counter-offensive, coupled with reduced relief operations. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator Martin Griffiths described the plight of refugees and IDPs in the Shabunda and Lubutu regions as &quot;dire&quot; and warned that the situation could reach crisis proportions if the Kinshasa authorities prevented aid agencies from operating outside Kisangani. Humanitarian operations are being seriously hampered by the Zairean government's decision not to issue &quot;sauf-conduit&quot; permits due to the military operation. UNICEF said a total of 88 people, 47 of them children under five, had died in Tingi-Tingi between 15 and 19 January, mostly from malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. It reported 5,907 unaccompanied children in Tingi-Tingi, and 1,500 in Amisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi yesterday urged ADFL rebels to withdraw from the key towns of Goma, Bukavu, Uvira and Bunia to avert &quot;imminent war&quot; in the area, Kenyan radio reported. Once the rebels had moved out of these areas &quot;it will enable those concerned to seek solutions to the problem facing the Great Lakes region without further bloodshed,&quot; he was quoted as saying.  He added that he was opposed to foreign intervention in eastern Zaire as this would escalate existing problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The foreign ministers of four countries charged by the Nairobi-II regional meeting last month to oversee the Great Lakes conflict will meet in Pretoria, South Africa, on Monday and Tuesday. The Kenyan, South African, Zimbabwean and Cameroon foreign ministers will be joined by their Congolese and Tanzanian counterparts for what a Kenyan official described as a &quot; brainstorming session&quot;. The OAU secretary-general has also been invited to the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Diplomatic contacts with Burundi continued yesterday as Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu met Burundian leader Pierre Buyoya in the southern Rwandan town of Butare. Buyoya, who was accompanied by his foreign minister Luc Rukingama and defence minister Firmin Sinzoyiheba, held talks on the regional economic sanctions against his country. The two leaders also discussed the Great Lakes conflicts in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, concern continues to be expressed over the lack of fuel and difficult operating conditions for NGOs and the UN in Burundi. The existence of some 200 displaced people's camps has been reported in the country and there are heightened worries over conditions at the Maramvya camp, near Bujumbura. Over the past few weeks, hundreds of people have gathered spontaneously at the camp, with many suffering from severe malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Four major suspects in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 arrived in the Tanzanian town of Arusha yesterday where they will be tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The four, who were extradited from Cameroon, include Theoneste Bagasora, former defence ministry cabinet director who is accused of directing events in the first days of the massacres. The other three are a former transport minister Andre Ntagerura, a senior official of the extremist Mille Collines radio, Ferdinand Nahimana and a former lieutenant colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva. The four are now in detention in Arusha. Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said the transfer of the four from Cameroon &quot;marks a capital turning point for the credibility of the international tribunal&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, EASTERN ZAIRE TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. GENERAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The 1997 UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for the Great Lakes Region is now scheduled to be released during the second week of February. The appeal will provide detailed caseload planning figures, food requirements and expected shortfalls for the region for the period January-December 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. EASTERN ZAIRE - most information as of 19 January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Kisangani</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The first 250 metric tons of maize, of a consignment of 2,000 metric tons, arrived by a combination of rail and river barge in Kisangani on 22 January from Lusaka, Zambia. The cereal will be onforwarded overland and by aircraft to reach the refugees gathered in Tingi Tingi, Amisi and the Shabunda area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Airlift operations from Kisangani to Tingi Tingi and Amisi resumed after a brief suspension which had been at the request of Zairean authorities, but normal schedules are being disrupted due to insufficient availability of planes. Only 19 metric tons were dispatched during the week: 12 metric tons to Tingi-Tingi, 5 metric tons to Amisi and 2 metric tons to Shabunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) No flights to Kisangani took place during the present week due to maintenance of the Boeing 707. Air operations are expected to be resumed on 24 January. Between 13-19 January 364 metric tons of food were delivered to Kisangani, plus non-food items from WFP, MSF and UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) On 20 January, the Prime Minister of Zaire announced a counteroffensive to recover territories currently occupied by Tutsi rebels. Kisangani is witnessing increased military activities but the security situation is reported to be normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e) Stocks in Kisangani as of January 20 amounted to 446 metric tons of food, of which 110 metric tons were UNICEF Unimix. WFP has three warehouses in Kisangani with an estimated capacity of 1,000 metric tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Tingi Tingi and Amisi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) About 150 cases of diarrhoea are being diagnosed every day in Tingi Tingi, some of which are reported as being cholera cases. UNICEF and MSF are endeavouring to control the situation. Lack of water in Amisi is a matter of concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Shabunda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) As described in the previous Emergency Report, Shabunda hosts thousands of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi and internally displaced Zaireans.  Refugees, mostly arrived from Bukavu and Uvira, are spontaneously settled at three locations on the left bank of Ulindi river while displaced Zaireans are living in poor conditions among local population. WFP has delivered by air 4 metric tons of Unimix and maize flour and UNICEF will arrange the distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Some 550 families from Kaseke/Shabunda arrived at Tingi Tingi on 17 January. These families were registered by UNHCR and given high-energy biscuits before settling. Some refugee groups are still arriving in Shabunda from Katshunguru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 Goma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) General insecurity appears to have slowed down the rhythm of repatriation. A total 863 refugees repatriated during the week of 13-19 January at a daily average of 144 persons. This is a reduction by 43% as compared to the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Efforts to assess situation in Masisi frustrated as still no passage is allowed beyond the last rebel held check point at Mushaki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) Communications equipment of various agencies has been expropriated by the local authorities in an action seen as an attempt to curtail external communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 Bukavu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Organised and spontaneous repatriation through the Bukavu areas still increasing. Between 13-19 January, 12,855 persons repatriated, an increase of almost 30% as compared to the previous week. WFP distributed 9 metric tons of high-energy biscuits to a total 28,659 returning refugees. The transport capacity to shuttle returning refugees has been increased. UNHCR can now transport a maximum 2,500 refugees per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Road access from Bukavu to Shabunda still not permitted to humanitarian agencies. Access to northern areas is restricted to 115 km on the Bunyakiri road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 In an overnight attack on the past weekend in Ruhengeri, three Medicos del Mundo (MDM) staff were shot dead and another was seriously wounded. MDM have suspended activities in Rwanda until a thorough investigation is carried out. Humanitarian operations in insecure areas in Rwanda will not be suspended but international aid agencies are enhancing security measures.  This decision was agreed at a joint UN/NGO/Government meeting in Kigali, following the above incident and other recent incidents targeting aid workers in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 WFP has acceded to a request from the Government of Rwanda to extend food distributions to returnees from two to six months. At the end of this period, the situation will be reviewed. It was further determined that food- for-work activities to be implemented will emphasise house building and land reclamation projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 While food distributions are being handed over from NGOs to local authorities, WFP will continue to deliver the food to the communes for handling and distribution by the communal authorities. WFP has proposed guidelines to ensure transparent and effective implementation of food distributions. To date, WFP has provided 23,810 metric tons of food (1.48 million monthly rations) for distribution to returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 The Government of Rwanda announced that Burundian refugees must go home.  UNHCR is discussing the issue with the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.5 An average 1,000 people a day are still crossing the border at Rusumo, coming from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Residents of the new &quot;regroupement&quot; camps and other displaced people are receiving food assistance from WFP in Ngozi and Karuzi provinces. The current distribution programme will assist approximately 80,000 people in this area. Populations affected by the conflict in Burundi have been grouped by the authorities in these collection camps over the past six to eight months, apparently to protect them from being used as shields by the rebels fighting the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 Fuel shortages likely to hamper humanitarian activities, as no authorisation has so far been received from the Regional Sanctions Co- ordinating Committee. Only one fuel shipment has been allowed since the beginning of the embargo in July 1996 and agencies' stocks are virtually depleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Violence continues to plague Burundi with increasing numbers of attacks, killings and ambushes now becoming customary. During the last week, security incidents were reported in the majority of the provinces of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 From 13-19 January, WFP Burundi assisted 167,951 people, mostly displaced populations affected by the civil strife who received two week rations. Total food distributions during the week amounted to 746 metric tons.  Stocks in Burundi as of 19 January totalled 2,445 metric tons of various foods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The Government of Uganda has requested WFP to provide immediate food assistance to 20,000 displaced people who fled their homes after fighting broke out in Kitgum district, northern Uganda. About 400 people lost their lives during the attacks. Resources need to be identified for this group, for a total 291 metric tons of mixed foods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. SOMALIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP-Somalia is preparing a contingency plan for various supply channels into Somalia relating to the reports of drought in the region. Preparations are underway for WFP to move 800 metric tons of mixed commodities from Dar Es Salaam and Mombasa to the Somalian refugee camp warehouse at Dadaab (Kenya) in order to be in a position to respond quickly with an intervention in the Juba Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. ANGOLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The second expansion of WFP Protracted Relief Operation (PRO) 5602 was approved on 22 January by the WFP Executive Board. This operation calls for 96,033 metric tons of food commodities to assist some 662,000 displaced and war affected persons from March 1997-February 1998. The project, while continuing to contribute to relief efforts, emphasizes increasing support for resettlement and rehabilitation activities, for example through food-for-work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 A Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) Unit is being established within the WFP office in Luanda. The unit will work with the Government of Angola, NGOs and donors to collect and analyse data to identify areas of food insecurity and beneficiaries in need of assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP participated in a second UCAH-led (DHA) joint assessment mission to the Chicuma area in Benguela province on 14-15 January. The mission confirmed that reports of a large-scale emergency due to population displacement were overstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 WFP has signed bilateral agreements with Save the Children Federation- USA and World Vision. WFP will provide handling, storage and transport for approximately 30,000 metric tons of food aid (about 15,000 metric tons each) during 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. LIBERIA AND SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. LIBERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Demobilisation has picked up in the past week, with 400 soldiers demobilising per day. A total of 9,084 soldiers have been demobilised from 22 November-21 January. A new demobilisation site at Saw Mill (ULIMO-K) was established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 The international humanitarian community continues to note that a lack of sufficient logistical support, combined with insecurity in many parts of the country, are hindering the demobilisation process. Although some faction leaders have claimed to be committed to completing disarmament by the 31 January deadline, many factions continue not to co-operate in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Nine persons were killed on the Bomi Highway in an ambush on 16 January.  ULIMO-J fighters are said to be among the victims. Reports also indicate increased tension in Monrovia with incidents of kidnapping, murder and police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The 20 December 1996 suspension on humanitarian activities in Grand Cape Mount County was lifted at the beginning of January. The suspension was put into effect following a series of incidents, including the harassment of civilians and humanitarian aid workers, the seizure of a European Union truck and the attempted hijacking of a DHA vehicle. General distribution has not yet re-commenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 In the first humanitarian mission to Zwedru since the April 1996 crisis, WFP successfully delivered 8.3 metric ton food. Food and supplies are also being positioned in Greenville, where demobilisation is expected to begin this week. Medical NGOs are also in the process of reactivating hospital activity in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 In the transition from relief to resettlement and targeted food assistance for 1997, all general food distributions in Sierra Leone have been phased out, with the last distributions completed on 24 December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Four agencies will be responsible geographically for the food supply to Sierra Leone in 1997: WFP, CRS, World Vision and CARE. This approach is expected to ensure better targeting of available resources and avoid parallel distribution among suppliers and implementing partners. WFP will concentrate distribution in the north-west, western area and adjacent areas of Tonkili and Moyamba districts, Bo north, and the south-eastern part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Significant numbers of internally displaced persons have already been resettling throughout the country with an estimated 25% of displaced persons nation-wide and 50% of the registered displaced in Bo town having returned to their place of origin in the past month. Improved security in most of the country has been the main factor behind this return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 The first WFP resettlement package distributions began on 21 January in Bo district. Some 7,450 persons are expected to be served from the Yormandu, Gerihun and Baoma distribution centres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report No. 19 Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, January 24, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire, and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire, more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted the Banyarwanda in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control. In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu began to resemble that of the Masisi region, as government-sanctioned harassment of Banyamulenge Tutsis intensified. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp, in South Kivu, forcing the roughly 220,000 refugees to flee. The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira to Bukavu, and south from Rutshuru (North Kivu) to Goma. As a result of shelling October 26 and November 1, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kibumba, Katale, and Kahindo camps near Goma, fled south to Mugunga camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Hutu attacks from Mugunga camp on Goma town, the ADFL counter-attacked from the east on November 14, forcing the ex-FAR and Interahamwe to retreat west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to return to Rwanda, while others fled north and west into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last two months, the ADFL has continued its advance north of Goma, capturing the gold-mining town of Bunia on December 24. Zairian prime minister Kengo wa Dondo announced on January 20 the beginning of a counter- offensive to retake territory lost to the rebels, and issued a declaration of war against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date) -$121,754, 335</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan refugees: An estimated 555,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from the Eastern Zaire camps to Rwanda between November and the end of December.  About 730,000 have returned since November, 1996, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR claims there are about 320,000 Rwandans stranded in Eastern Zaire, including 120,000 in Tingi-Tingi, just to the south of Lubutu, 40,000 in Amisi, 70 km southeast of Lubutu, Haut Zaire; 60,000 in Shabunda, including about 5,000 Burundians, and about 100,000 others are dispersed in smaller groups in South Kivu and Maniema provinces. Since January 13, about 2,000 refugees a day have been returning to Rwanda from South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 540,000 Rwandan refugees who were in Tanzania, 483,445 returned during 1996, according to the UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area, some 64,000 refugees have returned to Burundi and about 13,500 have arrived in Tanzania. Between 45,000-55,000 refugees are missing, with 38, 000 believed by the UNHCR to be in Shabunda, others between Fizi and Kalemie, and an unknown number dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently about 243,000 Burundian refugees in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly Displaced: Fleeing continued fighting in Burundi, a new caseload of about 100,000 Burundian refugees has entered Tanzania since December.  Approximately 35,000 Zairians have fled to Tanzania. Since October 1996, about 600 Rwandan, Burundian, and Zairian refugees have entered Zambia from Zaire and Tanzania, the UNHCR reports. Some 800 Rwandan and Zairian Tutsis remain in the Congo and 11,500 Zairians are reported in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR estimates there are 7,000 internally displaced Zairians in Shabunda, and about 5,000 have fled towards Amisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since December 31, about 100 people have died in a dozen armed clashes in Rwanda. On the evening of January 18 in Ruhengeri town, about 100 km northwest of Kigali, gunmen killed three Spaniards and seriously wounded an American. All worked for Medicos del Mundo (MDM), a relief agency funded by USAID/BHR/OFDA. Three Rwandan soldiers were also killed. The American, who consequently had a leg amputated, was evacuated to Nairobi. At nearly the same time as the attack on the MDM house, other attacks were launched on houses occupied by workers with Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) and Save the Children Fund (SCF). There were no casualties in the other attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) states that the killers belong to the ex- FAR/Interahamwe. The press reports that two suspects arrested in connection with the MDM killings have died in Government of Rwanda (GOR) custody. NGO operations in the prefecture have been scaled back but not suspended. Also in Ruhengeri prefecture, unidentified persons on January 20 killed at least 24 unarmed Rwandans belonging to a civil patrol in Ruhengeri prefecture. Rwandan security forces are searching for the gunmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence follows disturbing events of the previous week in northwest Rwanda. On January 11, about 60 armed Rwandans, believed to be Interahamwe, attacked the hospital in Kabaya, in Gaseke commune, Gisenyi prefecture. The attackers killed one person, wounded three, and looted medical supplies, according to MSF, which works in the hospital. On January 13 in Giciye commune, also in Gisenyi prefecture, armed men destroyed a vehicle belonging to the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR). No one was injured, although two HRFOR expatriates were threatened. The next day, a Chinese road crew in Gisenyi prefecture was attacked and beaten by armed men.  The RPA is undertaking a cordon and search operation to find the attackers, the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) reported. Since the attacks, most NGOs have scaled back their activities in the communes in Gisenyi that lie east of the Gishwati forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR reported that as of December 31, 473,082 Rwandan refugees had returned from Tanzania since December 14, and that the mass return from Tanzania has ended. Although most Rwandan refugees have returned from Eastern Zaire, about 320,000 remain, the UNHCR states. Relief agencies are concerned about the refugees' health, especially the children in the Tingi-Tingi and Amisi camps, in Haut-Zaire province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF conducted an epidemiological survey in Tingi-Tingi, which showed a mortality rate in children under five of 10/10,000 per day, between January 6 and 13. The rate was five times the alert threshold. The main causes of death are malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria. UNICEF on January 24 reported an average death rate in Tingi-Tingi of 20 per day, of whom half are under five.  With Action Contre la Faim (ACLF), MSF operates a supplementary feeding center in Tingi-Tingi that is treating 2,200 children, and a therapeutic feeding center that is treating 250 children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF reported that as of January 21, 526 refugees had died at Tingi-Tingi, 287 of them under five, since December 18, with 22 dying on January 21 alone.  UNICEF reports that it is targetting 20,000 children and vulnerables at the seven health centers in Tingi-Tingi. It has a staff of 19 who operate in the Kisangani/Tingi-Tingi/Amisi area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Eastern Zaire, foreign mercenaries are believed to be assembling in Kisangani, as reinforcements for the FAZ, in preparation for a counter-attack against the Alliance rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance leader Laurent Kabila stated on January 13 that FAZ and ex-FAR soldiers had entered the Bukavu-Shabunda-Kindu area recently, but had been defeated by the Alliance. On January 10, an Alliance officer told reporters of fighting at Mushaki, in the Goma area, in which at least three persons died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi on January 10, Burundian soldiers killed 126 returnees who had just arrived from Tanzania. The killings occurred at Kobero, Muyinga province, where the returnees had been brought in Tanzanian army trucks. The massacre followed the Tanzanian authorities' decision to expel the returnees, who belonged to the militant Palipehutu faction, after they clashed with another Burundian military group in the Kitali Hills refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Government (USG) and the U.N. Secretary-General on January 13 expressed shock at the massacre, and urged the Government of the Republic of Burundi (GRB) to prevent further killings. After the massacre, the Burundi army arrested seven soldiers who are suspected of involvement in the killings.  WFP recently reported fighting in Muramvya and the presence of land mines on roads in Kayanza province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon deported four Rwandans to the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania. The four suspects, who were due to arrive in Tanzania by airplane on January 23, include Theoneste Bagasora, who is accused of participating in the planning of the genocide. In Arusha, the trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu, accused of involvement in the murder of 2,000 Rwandans in Taba, continues. Another 12 suspects remain in custody in Arusha, awaiting trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts The Government of Canada hosted a multi-donor meeting in Kigali on December 13 on the reintegration of Rwandan refugees.  Representatives from 12 countries, the European Union, U.N. agencies, and the Government of Rwanda (GOR) met to discuss developments since the refugees began returning on November 15, to present GOR priorities, to review donor programs, and to discuss donor coordination efforts. The GOR reiterated its priorities of housing, security, justice and human resource development and called on donors to support whole communities, including returnees and existing residents alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A briefing given by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the WFP in Rome on January 13 stated that food availability in the Great Lakes is satisfactory for the immediate future, and that the main need was to reestablish traditional production methods. The assessment contrasted with an FAO/WFP report on Rwanda on January 15, which stated that for the first half of 1997, Rwanda faced a shortage of 30,000 MT of cereals, 45,000 MT of pulses, 124,000 MT of roots and tubers, and 522,000 MT of bananas. The return of more than one million returnees, coupled to the effects of dry weather and low pulse yields, are responsible for the shortages, the organizations reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire: Between January 6 and 12, WFP transported 451 MT of food to Kisangani, and 72 MT to Tingi-Tingi. WFP trucks are hauling some food overland from Kisangani to Lubutu, despite incidents of intervention by the FAZ. Other food supplies are flown to Lubutu, where the airstrip can accomodate aircraft carrying 3 MT. &gt;From there food is trucked to Tingi-Tingi.  The Amisi airstrip can receive aircraft bearing 6 MT, and from there trucks also take food to Tingi-Tingi. WFP has distributed 260 MT in Tingi-Tingi, 24 MT in Amisi, and 19 MT to internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 15, the WFP plane in Amisi was surrounded by several dozen members of the FAZ and refugees who wanted to be flown to Kisangani. WFP workers fended them off, however. The governor of Kisangani cancelled commercial and humanitarian flights out of Kisangani on January 16-18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is operating two way stations to receive Rwandan returnees on their way home via Goma. Karuba station is 17 km west of Sake, and Kilolwire station is 35 km north of Sake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From January 6 to 8, 4,181 Rwandan returnees entered from Zaire at border crossings in Cyangugu, the USAID/DART reported. The figure of these three days represents about one-half the number who returned during the entire month of December 1996. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) reported that 5,000 refugees were seen heading southeast on the Walikale-Bukavu road, and Rwandan refugees claimed that 20,000-50,000 of their compatriots remained in Hombo, north of Makwe. The ICRC is transporting refugees from Shaminunu to the Ruzizi crossings at the Bukavu-Cyangugu border. The ICRC quoted Zairians as claiming that another 30,000 refugees were near Shaminunu, west- northwest of Bukavu. The IRC, which operates a transit point with MSF/International at Bunyakiri, reported that refugees arriving from Makwe were in fairly good health. The UNHCR reported shortages of fuel and jerrycans, and stated that it would hire more trucks in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda: The UNHCR reports that 1,300,582 refugees returned to Rwanda in 1996: 719,307 returned from Zaire, 483,445 from Tanzania, 88,309 from Burundi, and 9,521 from Uganda. About 11,000 Rwandans entered Rwanda at Cyangugu during January 11-18, including 4,000 on January 17-18, the UNHCR reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 31, the GOR announced that all food should be distributed through local authorities, and not NGOs, as previously practiced. The WFP was requested to transport food to the communes, from which the UNHCR would take it to distribution points. After several meetings in early January, the GOR and WFP agreed that NGOs would complete their work as food distributors by January 22, and the GOR, as formally head of implementation, would assist in unloading food trucks at extended supply points. Since mid-November, WFP has provided and has helped distribute 16,256 MT of food, representing monthly rations to 972,752 people throughout Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By mid-December, GOR authorities hade also registered 1,931 members of the ex-FAR in Gisenyi prefecture. Authorities are still compiling registrations in other prefectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for permanent shelter poses a major concern for the GOR, which estimates that there is a need for 200,000-250,000 homes nationwide. WFP and UNHCR both report to have built about 6,000 new houses in 1996. The UNHCR distributed 13,182 shelter kits as of November 30, 1996. Officially, the GOR gives squatters two weeks to vacate dwellings belonging to returnees but implementation of this policy appears varied at the commune level. In Gitarama, Kibuye, Cyangugu, and Butare prefectures, USAID/DART has observed that shelter programs targeted at old caseload returnees and vulnerable persons often suffered from these shortcomings: settlements are sometimes in areas without water or adequate land for farming, used inadequate construction materials, and did not involve future occupants in the construction. In contrast, USAID/DART noted that the scattered settlement shelter programs have been more successful. The 1,300 units which Concern built in Butare prefecture and 1,600 in Cyangugu prefecture are occupied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trials of Rwandans suspected of involvement in the 1994 genocide began on December 27 in Kibungo. There are 1,914 names on the category one list, which refers to defendants who are suspected of having planned, organized, instigated, supervised, or led the genocide or a crime against humanity. If found guilty, category one defendants face the death penalty. Eight defendants have been found guilty to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi: Six months after neighboring countries imposed economic sanctions against Burundi, NGOs and U.N. agencies are encountering delays in importing essential goods, and their fuel reserves are nearly empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the country remains insecure, due to ethnic tensions. Fighting is reported to be increasing in northern Kayanza province, thereby limiting NGOs' ability to deliver assistance. MSF Holland (MSF/H) announced on January 6 that it was suspending its operations because of insecurity. In the past two months, 12 confirmed mine explosions have destroyed military and civilian vehicles, UNDHA reports. Eight of the explosions occurred in Bujumbura Rural province. Burundi authorities accused Hutu rebels of killing 22 people in Rugombo, Cibitoke province, on January 13. UNHCR reports that as of January 6, about 64,000 Burundian returnees arrived from Zaire. Most returned directly to Cibitoke and Bubanza, both severely affected by the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past several weeks, about 250 people are suspected of having contracted cholera in communities near Rumonge, Bururi province, about 80 km southeast of the capital. Ten have died from the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) is investigating the suspected outbreak. Also in Rumonge, Burundi state radio reported the deaths of at least 15 persons in attacks on January 18-19 by unidentified armed men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USAID/OFDA Emergency Disaster Relief Coordinator (EDRC) reported during a trip to Muyinga and Ngozi provinces on December 5-7 that much land was poorly tended and malnutrition rates had reportedly risen. Much of the rural population of Muyinga had left for Tanzania, residents said. Because of the low-level civil war, traditional life in the two provinces had given way to mono-ethnic communities which were not agriculturally self-sufficient. In contrast, the EDRC found traditional life relatively unchanged while visiting Ruyigi and Rutana provinces on December 14-17. In Ruyigi, many people appeared to have stayed to work the land, despite recent fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania: The Government of Tanzania (GOT) announced on January 21 the formal end to its exercise to repatriate Rwanda refugees. The GOT is cleaning up the campsites, and has declared that those Rwandans who escaped from the Tanzanian camps instead of repatriating, and who are now hiding, would be considered illegal aliens. About 278,000 refugees, of whom 243,000 are Burundian, remain in Tanzania, the UNHCR reports. In the Ngara camps, there are 82,100 Burundians; in Kibondo, there are 96,813 refugees; in Kasulu, there are 89,702 Burundians and Zairians; in Kigoma town there are about 5, 000 refugees. UNHCR reported that 34,000 new refugees arrived in Tanzania from Zaire and Burundi in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian security forces have identified 51 Rwandan intimidators and moved them to facilities in Mwiza, 10 km west of Kyaka, Karagwe district. The camp opened on December 20 with 51 refugees, all male except for a woman and her child. Most if not all are believed to have been heavily involved in the genocide. One has since voluntarily repatriated to Rwanda, leaving 50 at Mwiza, USAID reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the forced repatriation of the 122 Palipehutu Burundians, who were immediately massacred by the Burundian Army on January 10, internecine clashes had resulted in 10 deaths and the arrest of 200 refugees in late December. Of the 200, 118 were taken to Ngara and 48 of the them were turned over to Burundian authorities and reportedly killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda, to conduct assessments, report on the situation, and provide funding to NGOs, U.N.  agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist with repatriation efforts. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Robert Gribbin, declared a disaster, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire posed a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda. On November 12, U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson declared a disaster in Zaire as a result of the violent break- up of refugee camps in eastern Zaire. On November 18, the USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian and development assistance to address needs in the Great Lakes region. On November 25, Ambassador Morris Hughes declared a disaster in Burundi as a result of continuing civil strife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - SUDAN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (ERP) January - June 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFSD71 -- Appeal Target: US$ 867,894</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disease, floods and drought conditions have exacerbated the serious conditions of the war-affected people of Sudan. The situation in the country has also been created and compounded by continuing economic and political factors. Here is a complex emergency that has largely been forgotten by the outside world but which continues to cause death, destruction and enormous suffering. Therefore emergency needs will continue in 1997 for a carefully targeted and programed response to reach out to the people of this land in crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamental causes of human suffering in the Sudan since 1983 have been civil war and drought. The war, which erupted in 1983 has claimed many lives, destroyed property, created massive displacement of people and diverted large amounts of money out of development. According to the United Nations Humanitarian Coordination Unit (UNHCU), an estimated 2.5 million Sudanese are internally displaced, including 1.8 million in Khartoum, 350,000 in the transition zone (southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, northern Bahr el Ghazal and the northern Upper Nile States) and government-held garrison towns, 150, 000 in camps in Equatoria and additional tens of thousands elsewhere. In addition, Sudanese continue to flee from southern Sudan because of insecurity and civil strife. Currently, there are an estimated 399,500 Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to resolve the current war peacefully have been unsuccessful. And though the theatre of this civil war is mainly in the south, its effects are seriously felt throughout the country. In the north the effects of war has paralysed the economy, weakened basic infrastructures and claimed the lives of many youths conscripted into the army to fight what is claimed as a *holy war' against the southerners. Moreover, the north, and particularly Khartoum, is host to a massive number of internally displaced people and refugees. In the south, the fragmentation of political factions and the subsequent intra- factional feuds have only compounded the situation of this war-torn society.  Ongoing insecurity and population displacement in the south and the transition zones have not only interrupted or destroyed most of the indigenous trading and productive systems, but have also been a major impediment to relief efforts. And against this backdrop, the civil war continues with the people being subjected to aerial bombings, conflict on the ground and forced relocations due to the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent Food and Agriculture Organization/World Food Program (FAO/WFP) Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission to Sudan and our own Network conclude that, in view of the economic situation which continues to create instability in the north and the prevailing civil strife and insecurity in the South, food aid assistance will still be necessary for the following categories of displaced persons and other affected people in 1997:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internally displaced camps and villages within their own communities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drought and flood victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other vulnerable groups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACTion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some time it was proposed to carry out an evaluation of the Sudan Council of Churches Emergency Response Program. This wasachieved in October/November 1996, prior to the Round Table. The Terms of Reference of the evaluation team were: to describe and analyze the current structure and functioning of the ERP; to evaluate ERP's efficiency and effectiveness in reaching its objectives; to identify internal and external constraints and describe how ERP is dealing with these constraints; to give recommendations on how SCC can improve ERP's future performance; and, to evaluate the role of humanitarian assistance in the context of the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After thorough evaluation of the ERP program, several conclusions were reached and recommendations were made (copies of the detailed report are available at the ACT Coordinating Office). It was proposed that while the recommendations were being implemented during the first six months of 1997, an interim budget, addressing solely the emergency needs within the ERP program, should be elaborated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SCC has therefore developed a proposal that will a) implement the recommendations of the ERP evaluation and b) focus the emergency response in the Northern Region (Khartoum and Kosti), Equatoria (Juba), Upper Nile (Malakal, Wadakona and Bentiu), Western Region (El Obeid, Kadugli, Abyei and Meiram), Bahr el Ghazal (Wau, Raga and Aweil), Blue Nile Region (Damazin) and Eastern Sudan (Gaderef), to reach 172,028 beneficiaries as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vulnerable groups - 92,499 persons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplementary Feeding - 21,417 persons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School Feeding - 29,323 persons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emergency Relief - 28,789 persons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Distribution to the target groups - the vulnerable, supplementary feeding, school feeding and emergency relief - will be preceded by a needs assessment. The needs assessment teams in each program area will be composed of SCC/ERP staff, Inter-church Committee (ICC) members, beneficiary representatives, representatives of Local Relief Committees and SCC Nutritionists. Each team will compile a register of those who are assessed as being critically insecure in food and nutritionally vulnerable. The actual distribution of relief food to the registered beneficiaries will be preceded by the distribution of ration cards in order to avoid duplication or misuse.  The teams will monitor the distribution of food up to end use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal focuses on the acute survival needs of the above mentioned categories. In the *Vulnerable' target group, ACT/SCC will provide cereals, pulses and edible oil to a total number of 92,499 pregnant women, lactating mothers, the elderly, handicapped, orphans and widows over a period of 90 days. The supplementary feeding program will assist 21,417 children under the age of five for 180 days. They will receive rations comprising cereals, pulses, oil, sugar, dried skimmed milk (DSM) and biscuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools run by member churches will receive cereals pulses and oil to provide food for 29,323 school children for a period of 168 days. Emergency relief for 28,789 new arrivals and the destitute who have been affected by drought and floods will receive rations of cereals, pulses and oil for 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to enhance the capacity of the Emergency Response Program staff and the churches involved in the ERP program, regional workshops will be held in Eastern/Blue Nile, Bahr el Ghazal, Northern Region, Equatoria and Western Region. These workshops will focus on all aspects of relief management.  Moreover, the ERP national staff will undertake visits to program areas on a regular basis to provide technical support, assess the performance of the program and review human resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall budget has been calculated at a total amount of $1,489,544 for this six-month period. However, after taking into account anticipated remittances from donors for funds to cover inland transport/storage/handling costs of stocks currently in the pipeline and an outstanding pledge, the amount being sought from ACT Partners in this appeal stands at $867,894.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implementing Partner: Sudan Council of Churches (SCC)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KADOMA, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Projected diminishing rains in sub-Sahara Africa will likely harm man, the ecology, reduce food production and shut down dams, a Zimbabwean government official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By 2025 it is estimated that all the major river basins in Africa, other than the Congo, will be water scarce,&quot; Todd Ngara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was making a presentation on climate change at an environment workshop in Kadoma, about 150 kilometers south-west of Harare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngara, who heads the Climatic Change Department in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, said Hydro-electric projects in many countries like Ghana, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe were at risk of collapsing because of the climatic changes which brought recurrent droughts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major source of electricity in Zimbabwe, Lake Kariba is at its lowest level ever, threatening the generation of electricity serving the country and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More vector-borne diseases would affect people, he said, because of the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said atmospheric concentrations of green house gases, which are responsible for the climatic changes, were increasing rapidly due to the continued use of fossil fuels, changes in land use and agricultural practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Energy generation from fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and jet fuel are a source of high carbon content in the atmosphere,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cement and fertilizer factories are a source of the poisonous nitrogen and carbon dioxides in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The felling of trees and burning of forests for agriculture has also contributed to carbon dioxide in the air, while resettlement of landless people has contributed to the clearing of indigenous woodlands, which are a source of fresh air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, (Zimbabwe) government is encouraging afforestation so as to achieve a zero net of green house gas emissions to balance between depletion and regeneration,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop, which ended Thursday, was organized by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism. It was in preparation for the production of the State of the Environment Report in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 70 participants attended. They were drawn from various government departments, non-governmental bodies, scientific and research organizations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique has launched an autobiography of his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni, entitled &quot;Sowing the Mustard Seed: The Struggle for Democracy in Uganda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book's launch Sunday in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, was among highlights of the events marking the 11th anniversary of the seizure of state power by Museveni and his National Resistance Army guerilla fighters, on Jan.  26, 1986. Speaking at a commemorative state banquet the same day, Chissano, who was the anniversary's chief guest, called for greater cooperation between Mozambique and Uganda. &quot;We must identify further areas of cooperation, able to give great dynamism to our desire for the economic development and the well-being of our peoples,&quot; Chissano said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this, the Mozambique news agency, AIM, said Chissano challenged both governments &quot;to encourage our citizens, our businessmen and our governmental institutions to come together and develop a greater interest in promoting areas of cooperation for the common good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his banquet speech Museveni said Uganda, which registered a 3 percent inflation rate in 1996, could transmit to Mozambique its achievements in &quot; macro-economic stabilization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda is regarded as one of the few African states which has implemented successful economic structural adjustment programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier at the peak of the anniversary, Museveni decorated Chissano with the Ugandan Order, the Jewel of Africa First Class. This was in recognition of what Kampala said were Chissano's efforts &quot;to make Mozambique free, and his exemplary leadership and service to the Mozambican people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his commemorative address, Museveni said that even as FRELIMO, the Mozambican liberation front, fought its own war against Portuguese colonial rule, it helped train Ugandan guerrilla fighters for the struggle against the tyranny of Idi Amin, who was ousted in April 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni recalled that he first met Chissano in 1968 in the Tanzanian capital, when Chissano was head of FRELIMO's security department. Museveni was a student at the University of Dar Es Salaam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano eventually arranged Museveni's involvement in the Mozambican liberation struggle, which culminated in the country's independence from Portugal, on June 25, 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After winning independence, FRELIMO remained committed to the fight by Ugandans to overthrow Amin, who had seized power in a January 1971 coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mozambican military unit fought alongside the Tanzanian army all the way to Kampala, after Amin's costly mistake of invading a portion of Tanzanian territory in the last quarter of 1978.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian Football Association announced Monday that it had sacked the national soccer coach, Shuaibu Amodu for what it termed as &quot;gross misconduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu's dismissal came just hours after the association's chairman, Abdulmumini Aminu, told PANA that Amodu was on an indefinite suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason should be clear to every Nigerian,&quot; Aminu told PANA in Lagos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to Amodu's recent press statements criticizing the association and the minister of sports, Jim Nwobodo, on their recent decision to hire a foreign technical adviser for the national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the association's secretary, Sani Toro, said Amodu was fired because he breached his contract agreement by granting unauthorized press interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite &quot;several warnings,&quot; Toro said, Amodu granted an interview to a national newspaper in which he made &quot;embarrassing remarks on the activities of the association as well as the person of the sports minister.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu said that Amodu's absence would not affect the national team's programme, especially the planned qualification for the 1998 World Cup final in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going ahead with the plan to hire a foreign technical adviser, but we must take our time to avoid mistakes of the past,&quot; Aminu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointment, he added, would be made in time for Nigeria's crucial World Cup qualification match against Guinea in early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians have expressed dismay at the disappointing results of the country's national teams at all levels, coming after the nation's Olympic soccer victory in Atlanta, in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's Under-17 and Under-20 squads have been tossed out of current international competitions, while the senior team, returned a disappointing 1- 1 draw two weeks ago against lowly rated Kenya in an Africa zone qualification match for the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu could not be reached for a reaction to his sacking. But he had often told critics he could deliver the goods if given the level of encouragement and support, often lavished on foreign coaches hired by the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu's wife also joined the fray, saying in a recent press interview that Nigeria should not only hire a foreign technical adviser but also appoint a foreigner as sports minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu, former coach of Nigeria's BCC Lions, was appointed national coach after the unceremonious exit of former Dutch technical adviser, Clemens Westerhof, who led Nigeria to its first World Cup appearance in U.S.A.'94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu had been asked to coach the national team after Westerhof's compatriot and successor, Johannes Bonfrere, ditched Nigeria for the Gulf state of Qatar, in September 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere, who took Nigeria's Under-23 team to win the Olympic soccer gold in Atlanta, turned his back on the country mid-way into a two-year contract, alleging mistreatment by some of the country's football association officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association has reported him to the world's soccer governing body, FIFA, for alleged breach of contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KADOMA, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Projected diminishing rains in sub-Sahara Africa will likely harm man, the ecology, reduce food production and shut down dams, a Zimbabwean government official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By 2025 it is estimated that all the major river basins in Africa, other than the Congo, will be water scarce,&quot; Todd Ngara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was making a presentation on climate change at an environment workshop in Kadoma, about 150 kilometers south-west of Harare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngara, who heads the Climatic Change Department in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, said Hydro-electric projects in many countries like Ghana, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe were at risk of collapsing because of the climatic changes which brought recurrent droughts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major source of electricity in Zimbabwe, Lake Kariba is at its lowest level ever, threatening the generation of electricity serving the country and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More vector-borne diseases would affect people, he said, because of the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said atmospheric concentrations of green house gases, which are responsible for the climatic changes, were increasing rapidly due to the continued use of fossil fuels, changes in land use and agricultural practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Energy generation from fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and jet fuel are a source of high carbon content in the atmosphere,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cement and fertilizer factories are a source of the poisonous nitrogen and carbon dioxides in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The felling of trees and burning of forests for agriculture has also contributed to carbon dioxide in the air, while resettlement of landless people has contributed to the clearing of indigenous woodlands, which are a source of fresh air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, (Zimbabwe) government is encouraging afforestation so as to achieve a zero net of green house gas emissions to balance between depletion and regeneration,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop, which ended Thursday, was organized by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism. It was in preparation for the production of the State of the Environment Report in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 70 participants attended. They were drawn from various government departments, non-governmental bodies, scientific and research organizations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique has launched an autobiography of his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni, entitled &quot;Sowing the Mustard Seed: The Struggle for Democracy in Uganda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book's launch Sunday in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, was among highlights of the events marking the 11th anniversary of the seizure of state power by Museveni and his National Resistance Army guerilla fighters, on Jan.  26, 1986. Speaking at a commemorative state banquet the same day, Chissano, who was the anniversary's chief guest, called for greater cooperation between Mozambique and Uganda. &quot;We must identify further areas of cooperation, able to give great dynamism to our desire for the economic development and the well-being of our peoples,&quot; Chissano said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this, the Mozambique news agency, AIM, said Chissano challenged both governments &quot;to encourage our citizens, our businessmen and our governmental institutions to come together and develop a greater interest in promoting areas of cooperation for the common good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his banquet speech Museveni said Uganda, which registered a 3 percent inflation rate in 1996, could transmit to Mozambique its achievements in &quot; macro-economic stabilization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda is regarded as one of the few African states which has implemented successful economic structural adjustment programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier at the peak of the anniversary, Museveni decorated Chissano with the Ugandan Order, the Jewel of Africa First Class. This was in recognition of what Kampala said were Chissano's efforts &quot;to make Mozambique free, and his exemplary leadership and service to the Mozambican people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his commemorative address, Museveni said that even as FRELIMO, the Mozambican liberation front, fought its own war against Portuguese colonial rule, it helped train Ugandan guerrilla fighters for the struggle against the tyranny of Idi Amin, who was ousted in April 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni recalled that he first met Chissano in 1968 in the Tanzanian capital, when Chissano was head of FRELIMO's security department. Museveni was a student at the University of Dar Es Salaam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chissano eventually arranged Museveni's involvement in the Mozambican liberation struggle, which culminated in the country's independence from Portugal, on June 25, 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After winning independence, FRELIMO remained committed to the fight by Ugandans to overthrow Amin, who had seized power in a January 1971 coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mozambican military unit fought alongside the Tanzanian army all the way to Kampala, after Amin's costly mistake of invading a portion of Tanzanian territory in the last quarter of 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accepting the award, Chissano also recalled the military cooperation between FRELIMO and Museveni's guerrilla army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we Mozambicans were waging the struggle against colonial rule, our Ugandan brothers were fighting against the Idi Amin dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These were two realities in two different scenarios but what they had in common was the struggle for the freedom and dignity of our peoples,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to Amodu's recent press statements criticizing the association and the minister of sports, Jim Nwobodo, on their recent decision to hire a foreign technical adviser for the national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the association's secretary, Sani Toro, said Amodu was fired because he breached his contract agreement by granting unauthorized press interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite &quot;several warnings,&quot; Toro said, Amodu granted an interview to a national newspaper in which he made &quot;embarrassing remarks on the activities of the association as well as the person of the sports minister.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu said that Amodu's absence would not affect the national team's programme, especially the planned qualification for the 1998 World Cup final in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going ahead with the plan to hire a foreign technical adviser, but we must take our time to avoid mistakes of the past,&quot; Aminu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointment, he added, would be made in time for Nigeria's crucial World Cup qualification match against Guinea in early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians have expressed dismay at the disappointing results of the country's national teams at all levels, coming after the nation's Olympic soccer victory in Atlanta, in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's Under-17 and Under-20 squads have been tossed out of current international competitions, while the senior team, returned a disappointing 1- 1 draw two weeks ago against lowly rated Kenya in an Africa zone qualification match for the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu could not be reached for a reaction to his sacking. But he had often told critics he could deliver the goods if given the level of encouragement and support, often lavished on foreign coaches hired by the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu's wife also joined the fray, saying in a recent press interview that Nigeria should not only hire a foreign technical adviser but also appoint a foreigner as sports minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu, former coach of Nigeria's BCC Lions, was appointed national coach after the unceremonious exit of former Dutch technical adviser, Clemens Westerhof, who led Nigeria to its first World Cup appearance in U.S.A.'94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu had been asked to coach the national team after Westerhof's compatriot and successor, Johannes Bonfrere, ditched Nigeria for the Gulf state of Qatar, in September 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere, who took Nigeria's Under-23 team to win the Olympic soccer gold in Atlanta, turned his back on the country mid-way into a two-year contract, alleging mistreatment by some of the country's football association officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association has reported him to the world's soccer governing body, FIFA, for alleged breach of contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - GREAT LAKES GENERAL: Mohamed Sahnoun, an Algerian diplomat who once headed UN operations in Somalia, will be named as special representative for both the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) for the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* According to sources in the Zambian government and the local UNHCR office about 600 refugees have entered Zambia since October, 1996. Most are refugees who were forced to leave Tanzania...Local refugee officials are increasingly concerned, however, about the prospect of a major refugee influx from Shaba province or other areas of Zaire...Any serious refugee movement would quickly outstrip available resources and require significant donor intervention.  (Lusaka 470, 1/21/97)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MSF and UNICEF told the VOA on January 14 that &quot;the camp at Tingi-Tingi is controlled by former Rwandan officials of ethnic Hutu origin and armed Hutu militias.&quot; On January 20 UNHCR pulled out of a Kurdish refugee camp in northern Iraq because control of the CAM had been lost to guerillas, who are believed to hold the rest of the camp population hostage. The same logic should apply in Tingi-Tingi...The best way we can help is to stop feeding the killers, who will then run away to look for other sustenance, leaving their hostages behind. If we do not we will be trading the children in Tingi-Tingi against the children who will be killed and orphaned in Rwanda. (Kigali 283, 1/21/97)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REPATRIATION TO RWANDA:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Union for the Return of the Refugees and Democracy to Rwanda (RDR) issued a statement today blaming recent attacks on humanitarian organizations in Rwanda on the regime there...As evidence of prior Kigali regime animosity towards some humanitarian organizations, the communique claims some were expelled from Rwanda at the beginning of 1996 for opposing human rights violations,...that the RPF hates Spanish humanitarian organizations for refusing to abandon the refugees, and says Spanish Caritas workers were killed by the RPA in Nyamirangwe and Mudaka camps in South Kivu last fall.

The objectives of the FRI combatants are strictly military and target only positions of the army of occupation. At the same time, the FRI declines all responsibility for injuries which may be sustained by those who work and live with the soldiers of the army of occupation. It is therefore astonishing to remark that expatriates calling themselves humanitarians live with the army of occupation, ...where they are used as human shields...Since PALIR is determined to track down every soldier of the army of occupation wherever he may be, we can only counsel expatriates to keep their distance...(Kigali 330, 1/23/97)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Kigali's recent reporting on refugee reintegration issues was sparked by a specific tasking from Washington: what is the Government of Rwanda's reaction to the UNHCR reintegration plan? It turned out that the &quot;plan&quot; was a fund-raising tool sent only to donors...Goodwill prevails despite the coordination problems, which are to be expected when there are so many organizations involved in doing the same work...The coordination problems here are not the fault of the individuals at the various IOs and NGOs, but of their respective headquarters which sent them out on overlapping mandates.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Well-placed sources informed IRIN today that there has been intensive fighting around Walikale, including fixed-wing aircraft bombing raids. The sources indicated that the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) were still putting up resistance to the Zairean counter-offensive, and that the effect of bombing raids on the forested area was minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many inhabitants of Walikale town have reportedly fled to the surrounding areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADFL strenuously denied that Walikale had fallen to government troops.  Two reports in quick succession, broadcast by rebel radio (monitored by the BBC) on 24 and 25 January, accused the government of &quot;psychological warfare&quot;.  The commander of the rebel Armed Forces for the Protection of the Congolese People, a little-known ally of the ADFL, Col Francois Kipulu Waluwalu, asserted that Walikale was still under rebel control and claimed Zairean forces had lost 3,000 men since the war began. On 24 January, the radio said the government was &quot;engaged in a war of nerves through a media campaign&quot;.  Rebel radio also reports fighting at the Oso river bridge between Walikale and Lubutu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mystery surrounded the whereabouts of rebel commander Andre Ngandu Kissasse, described by Col. Waluwalu earlier this month as &quot;equivalent to 21 Zairean generals&quot;. Sources in eastern Zaire reported that Kissasse had been evacuated to Kampala along with Kisase, who according to rebel radio reports, had been wounded. Some reports say that Kisase had died in the Ugandan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Belgian daily Le Soir, a Belgian mercenary, Christian Taverniers, has admitted leading a force of 280 soldiers of fortune, equipped with combat helicopters in eastern Zaire. France continued to deny military involvement in Zaire and a foreign ministry spokesman contended that any French mercenary in Zaire was operating on a private basis and had no connection with French policy. AFP reported that some Zairean press reports accused the western media of &quot;hypocrisy&quot; by highlighting the fact that Zaire was using mercenaries while ignoring the alleged use of Rwandan, Burundian and Ugandan troops by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire meanwhile again rejected holding any dialogue with the rebels and a statement broadcast on national radio Saturday following a cabinet meeting, reaffirmed Kinshasa's resolve to recapture all territory under rebel control.  The statement also again accused Rwanda and Uganda of aiding the rebels.  Regional analysts point out that should the rebels start losing ground to government forces, it may be unlikely that Rwanda and Uganda will stand by and watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies continue to experience logistical problems in the refugee camps around Lubutu and Shabunda. WFP reported that some 550 families from Kaseke/Shabunda arrived in Tingi Tingi on 17 January, and refugee groups were still arriving in Shabunda from Katshungu. About 150 cases of diarrhoea are being diagnosed every day in Tingi Tingi, some of which are reported to be cholera cases. Humanitarian agencies are still being denied road access from Bukavu to Shabunda, and access to northern areas from Bukavu is restricted to 115km along the Bunyakiri road. Lack of access to affected populations and insecurity have been identified by UN agencies as the key operational problems in eastern Zaire at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Shabunda, refugees are spontaneously settled at three locations on the left bank of the Ulindi river, while displaced Zaireans are said to be living in poor conditions among the local population. Between 13-19 January, 12,855 people repatriated from Bukavu - an increase of almost 30 percent compared to the previous week, WFP said. However, further north in Goma, the rhythm of repatriation appeared to have been slowed down by general insecurity. In the same week, a total of 864 refugees repatriated, signifying a decrease of 43 percent compared to the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP also reported that the first overland consignment of food from Zambia (200 tonnes) arrived in Kisangani today. Another 250 tonnes are on the way.  The food travelled 2,000 km by train, truck, barge and ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the appointment of a UN special representative for the Great Lakes, Zairean Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda stressed his government wanted domestic issues, such as the democratisation process and elections, treated separately from Great Lakes issues. Zaire, therefore, had told the UN Secretary-General it wanted separate envoys to tackle the two issues. Kamanda wa Kamanda was in New York last week and was due to meet the prospective UN/OAU special envoy for the Great Lakes, Mohammed Sahnoun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Residents and bar owners in Bujumbura have hailed an announcement to ease the curfew in the Burundi capital. In an apparent indication of reduced tension in Bujumbura, national radio on Saturday said the curfew had been relaxed by two hours and would now begin at midnight local time. The measure coincides with a national debate which kicks off in Burundi tomorrow.  Speaking on Gabonese Africa No.1 radio, a government spokesman said the debate &quot;excludes no-one&quot;, although the authorities have said that groups, such as the banned National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), must renounce violence before they can participate. According to the radio, the main opposition party FRODEBU and three other parties grouped under the Forces for Democratic Change have refused to take part in the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan radio meanwhile reported yesterday that a FRODEBU delegation, led by its chairman Jean Minani, had just paid a visit to Rwanda and held talks with President Bizimungu and Vice-President Kagame, during which they discussed the economic embargo against Burundi. They agreed that solutions could not be found through fighting. Minani said FRODEBU would also be visiting other countries of the region such as Uganda and Kenya, noting this did not mean mediator Julius Nyerere had been bypassed, only that the Burundi issue was of concern to all countries who imposed the embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere himself, in an address to mark the 25th anniversary of the International Peace Academy in New York, acknowledged that peace efforts in Burundi had been largely unsuccessful. He argued that ethnicity was not a sufficient explanation for the conflict as ethnic groups had previously lived side by side and intermarried. He said he believed the root of the conflict lay in economics. &quot;The fight for power is mainly a fight for economic resources. Ethnicity is simply being exploited,&quot; he claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities in Burundi have denied allegations that troops massacred 400 civilians in the province of Muramvya earlier this month. Army spokesman Isaie Nibizi described the reports, which quoted alleged eyewitnesses, as &quot; absolutely and completely false&quot;. On January 5, the eyewitnesses said, soldiers and displaced Tutsis allegedly shot or hacked to death the civilians in Bukeye commune. &quot;Nothing happened in Bukeye on January 5,&quot; Nibizi affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Insecurity continued to dominate news from Rwanda with reports late Friday that a gang of some 21 unidentified gunmen attacked a secondary school in Bumba, Mabanza commune, Kibuye prefecture, killing a night watchman. Radio Rwanda said local residents were cooperating fully with the security forces.  In the troubled northwest Ruhengeri area, UN human rights monitors were still assessing the extent of the government's security sweep and terror acts by armed gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Major Western donors have written off one billion US dollars' worth of foreign debt, owed by Tanzania, expressing satisfaction with Tanzania's economic reforms. Acting Finance Minister Daniel Yona said the decision was taken by the Paris Club countries last Tuesday. He added that the remainder of the debt - $17 million US - would be repaid before the end of June.  However, the move by the Paris Club would be meaningless if the government failed to collect revenue fully and if production continued to be low, he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In a bid to persuade Ugandan rebels inside Sudan to surrender, the Ugandan army has delivered thousands of letters to rebel camps stating that a presidential amnesty still stands, the state-owned New Vision newspaper reported Saturday. An army officer told the newspaper that the armed forces would give protection to any member of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) who gave himself up. AFP said the army's attempt to talk the rebels out of the bush comes amid reports of escalating rebel activity in the West Nile. Sixty members of another rebel group, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), managed to reach the outskirts of Kasese town in the southwest, but were beaten back by the army, a Ugandan military official said on Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - COSATU and the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) met in Johannesburg on Monday the 27th of January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SFTU delegation was made up of their President Richard Nxumalo, and General Secretary Jan Sithole. COSATU's delegation was led by the Assistant General Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting took place at the request of the SFTU which wanted to brief COSATU on the developments in Swaziland, and SFTU's decision to embark on the two day national general strike on the 3rd and 4th February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU is convinced that the blame for this strike action lies squarely with the Swaziland government. Only two of the 27 demands have been met.  About 20 of the demands of the workers have been ignored or refused by the Swaziland government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demands relating to the democratisation of Swaziland have all not been met. The King has instead appointed a hand picked committee which is supposed to review the constitution. Once the international focus shifted from Swaziland, the King followed this appointment with a decree which made the work of the committee completely secret and undemocratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example the decree states the following :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) the constitutional review committee must not divulge to the public its work and deliberations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) the constitutional review committee must not report back to the public including the organisations which commissioners are members of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) the constitutional review committee is made up of individuals, not representatives of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU pledges its support and solidarity with the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, the workers in general and the people of Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We condemn the delaying tactics of the Swaziland government and their denial of worker and human rights in the strongest possible terms. To this end we call on COSATU members to go slow in handling the goods to and from Swaziland on the 3rd and 4th of February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swaziland government is attempting to resist the inevitable. Democracy shall triumph in Swaziland whether the current privileged few like it or not.  COSATU wishes to give Swaziland's undemocratic and unelected regime little advice that they should enter into genuine negotiations with the SFTU and other banned political organisations now instead of entering into negotiations when they are already on their knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU calls on all the employers in Swaziland to give full backing to the endeavours of the Swaziland workers to democratise Swaziland. There can be no stability in Swaziland until all the demands of the Swaziland majority have been met. Certainly the status quo is not in the interests of business as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vain attempts of the Swaziland government to aportion the blame to &quot; foreign forces&quot; is not going to help the situation. COSATU rejects with contempt these dirty tricks. The same tricks are familiar to COSATU as they were employed by the apartheid regime of the National Party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expressed grave concern today about the refugee situation in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The options are limited and stark, and things are getting worse not better, &quot; said High Commissioner Sadako Ogata in a statement issued in Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR is coordinating relief efforts for more than 200,000 refugees in Shabunda, Tingitingi and Amisi. It is looking at ways of repatriating those who want to go home. Delivery of emergency assistance remains difficult.In Shabunda, the airfield is waterlogged five out of seven days a week. UNHCR, the only agency present in Shabunda, has managed to set up health facilities with assistance from locals and refugees and reactivate and chlorinate water systems unused since agencies departed in December because of security conditions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite best efforts of UNHCR and its partners, Ogata said it was impossible to meet even the lifesaving needs of the most vulnerable refugees.  Insurmountable logistical difficulties in operating in refugee hosting areas are compounded by lack of security for people in need and staff of international agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is now a trickle of food coming through the international organizations,&quot; said UNHCR's Dillah Doumaye, who heads operations in the region, referring to some areas. &quot;However, the situation is extremely precarious, and if things do not improve, we will head toward a humanitarian disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many refugees, especially children, have already died from malnutrition or disease. In addition, the refugees risk finding themselves in the midst of war, as the conflict in Zaire moves closer to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While UNHCR, with its partners, is continuing to do what it can, and is in contact with authorities at the highest level, humanitarian organizations alone have little influence on events that threaten the lives of large numbers of refugees, and indeed of many Zairian civilians,&quot; Ogata said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem is that many refugees remain under the control of the former Rwandan leadership, elements of which are armed. Separation of these people and the refugees is even more difficult now than in the previous camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many refugees have indicated to UNHCR that they wish to repatriate to Rwanda. But repatriation would require a safe passage through the conflict zone and security and assistance along the route.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - COSATU has been involved in negotiations with government and business on the Employment Standards green paper since the Ministry of Labour released the document in February 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While progress has been achieved in many areas, the gap between parties is still very wide. Many stumbling blocks have emerged with business adopting a &quot; scatter gun&quot; approach to the negotiations. Business main strategy has been to reverse the current rights enjoyed by workers and water down even the inadequate and minimum provisions of the green paper. They are motivated by their ideology as pronounced in the &quot;Growth for all&quot; policy proposals viz.  labour flexibility and the two tier labour market system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side the government has been occupying middle ground and willing to embrace some position of business under pressure. The overall policy shift in the government at macro economic level has created an extra pressure on these negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU had discussed this state of affairs in its November 1996 EXCO and felt that there was a need for a sharp campaign to shift the ground. COSATU Affiliates, Regions and Locals have been asked to discuss the report on the status of negotiations. This includes areas where our constituency thinks we should modify some of our demands. The affiliates and regions will report to the EXCO scheduled for the 11-12 February 1997 where a programme of mass action will be developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU re-iterates its demands as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Variations - a &quot;more favourable&quot; test should apply which substitute the section of the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Six months maternity leave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. 40 Hour working week should at least be introduced in the next five(5) years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Double pay for Sunday work and etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call on all our members to attend meetings called by affiliates and regions to ensure that their views in this important matter are taken into consideration when the matter is finalised by EXCO.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - This urgent bulletin contains the findings and recommendations of a joint assessment mission to Zaire just completed by Refugees International and the U.S. Catholic Conference (USCC) Migration and Refugee Services. There are well over 200,000 refugees from Rwanda in the Lubutu and Shabunda areas of eastern Zaire and additional numbers of Zairian displaced persons, many of whom are clinging tenuously to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For three months the refugees and those internally displaced who accompanied them have been cut off from regular UN relief supplies of food and water. Owing principally to the resultant malnutrition, the health of the refugees is now declining precipitously. Many of the most vulnerable -- including infants and young children -- have already died, and more young lives are in the balance. For example, in Tingi Tingi alone, there are over 2, 000 children under five years old being kept alive with emergency supplementary feeding; more are being admitted each day. The cumulative effects of malnutrition, exhaustion and malaria will continue to cause mounting deaths among the refugees and internally displaced; nearly two- thirds of the deaths among this population have been children ages five years and under.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The humanitarian emergency in eastern Zaire has unfolded quietly and beyond the range of TV cameras and is therefore relatively unknown. In fact, after the repatriation to Rwanda of many refugees in November, doubt had been expressed in some quarters that there were many refugees still in Zaire.  There is no doubt now that they are in Zaire, but unless urgent measures are taken, many more will die. The objective of the international community should be to stabilize the refugees with emergency assistance and prepare the way for a safe repatriation to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continued fighting in the area, which has intensified with the recent launch of the Zaire counteroffensive, makes immediate mass repatriation impossible and complicates the delivery of even limited, life-sustaining emergency assistance. In this context, averting a humanitarian catastrophe in eastern Zaire will require extraordinary efforts by the international community, the relief agencies and the government of Zaire. There should be additional efforts elsewhere in eastern Zaire to identify refugees still missing, but, by accounts trying to survive and return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees International sent its president Lionel Rosenblatt along with Advocacy Associate Kirpatrick Day, and the U.S. Catholic Conference Migration and Refugee Service was represented by Shep Lowman, USCC's director of international refugee affairs. The assessment team recommends that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Given the extraordinary humanitarian and political stakes in eastern Zaire, the international community -- especially the U.S. -- must give much higher priority to the crisis. The prompt appointment of Mohammed Sahnoun by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as his Special Representative for the Great Lakes (wearing both UN and OAU hats) is a welcome first step. The Special Representative's efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and to protect and provide emergency assistance to refugees should begin immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There is broad consensus that no permanent refugee camps should be established. The objective is instead to provide minimum, temporary assistance until safe repatriation can be arranged. Supplies should be distributed through an ad hoc structure created by the relief agencies; the former commune structure, which exercised so much control in the former camps, must not be entrusted with distribution. Consideration should be given to a possible security role for the remaining element of the CZSC, the contingent assigned to and paid by UNHCR. Strong diplomatic pressure should be placed on the governments of Rwanda and Uganda to obtain rebel cooperation with any further overland repatriation to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The key to providing emergency assistance in time to avert massive loss of life will be to expand the delivery of the needed humanitarian supplies, equipment and personnel. While we understand Zaire's current preoccupation with the counter-offensive, the need for immediate, expanded access for relief flights is absolutely vital. Perhaps, opening up the use of the second, smaller airport at Kisangani would facilitate this if the flight slots for the regular airport cannot be immediately expanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The logistical obstacles to supplying the refugees are formidable. The road from Kisangani to the Lubutu area (where most of the refugees are located) is poor, and trucks take at least 4-5 days to make the round trip.  Unfortunately there are presently virtually no usable trucks on the ground.  Hence, in addition to expanding cargo flights into Kisangani, smaller aircraft are required to shuttle between Kisangani and the refugee/displaced sites. Measures to maintain (and perhaps expand) the runways at Amisi and Shabunda will be needed. Donors should signal immediately to WFP and the other UN agencies their willingness to fund the complex logistical measures required. In this regard, we were heartened to learn of the long-awaited decision to send an OFDA assessment mission to Zaire and look forward to a positive and generous U.S. response to the UN appeal for emergency assistance in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To reach the 30-40,000 refugees and displaced at Shabunda is particularly difficult. Light, DC-3 type aircraft land on a grass strip, which is damp and deteriorating even under the existing, light pressure. Flour sacks are then put on bicycles to a small river, where they are transshipped by canoe and re- loaded on bicycles. When the track gets too rough, the sacks are loaded on the backs of the refugees for the last stretch. The refugees and displaced are surviving by eating manioc leaves. Less than five tons of supplies have made it in to Shabunda. Given this logistical &quot;cul de sac,&quot; we urgently recommend that the Zaire authorities, in consultation with UN officials, identify a more sustainable (and more secure) site for the Shabunda population and facilitate an immediate movement of the population by foot, before they weaken any further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cholera is already present at Tingi Tingi, underscoring the high priority which should be given to bringing in emergency water pumps and chlorination means to use the existing available river water. Thus far, the cholera has been of a relatively less virulent strain, or mortality rates would already be even higher. The UN agencies require immediate assurances of funding to bring in the emergency water measures needed. Technical personnel are also needed to implement the measures at each site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Internally displaced Zairians (IDPs) and local villagers who are also struggling to survive should receive additional assistance. Some of this might be channeled in a way to strengthen local capacity. For example, a food for work program might be set up under which IDPs and affected villagers would assist in the repair of roads; such an approach would be cost-effective and could begin quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* UNHCR, in conjunction with the governments of Zaire and Rwanda, should arrange for repatriation by air for vulnerables, including orphans and unaccompanied minors. Those at Shabunda are in especially poor condition, suffering from malnutrition, exhaustion and malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The concentrations in the Lubutu and Shabunda areas do not constitute the sum total of &quot;lost&quot; refugees in eastern Zaire, and focus must also be placed on other pockets of refugees. For example, up to 2,000 refugees are now returning each day to Cyangugu, Rwanda from the Bukavu area. Given that, unlike in the north (Goma area), a significant repatriation channel did not open up in South Kivu, it is logical to assume that at least tens of thousands more may be present in that area, especially west and south of Bukavu. Other missing refugees from the Uvira/Fizi areas may well still be further to the south. Efforts to locate them and assist a safe return (in conjunction with the rebels) should be taken by UN agencies, ICRC and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sum, much more urgent and effective emergency assistance measures need to be put in place to enable minimum, life-sustaining assistance to get to the refugees and displaced in time. We call on the government of Zaire (and rebel leaders as necessary), donor governments and UN authorities to expedite the emergency humanitarian efforts along the lines described above. The situation is so complex and urgent that coordination within the UN must be tightened, preferably through the appointment of an emergency field coordinator with full authority to mobilize the UN agencies on the ground.  The world wasn't much interested when hundreds of thousands of refugees were dispersed into the forest. Will it save them, now that many of the &quot;lost&quot; refugees have been found?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a message addressed to the &quot;Special Committee of 24&quot;, the UN-Secretary- General underlines that is &quot;a particular need to support the MINURSO in the execution of its mandate on the holding of a free and fair referendum in what is the largest Territory on the Special Committee's agenda&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third European Congress of Socialist Youth adopts in Strasbourg the following resolution, proposed by Juventude Socialista, Portugal: ECOSY, reaffirming its attitude supporting the legitimate right of the sahrawi people to self-determination and independence, denounces the difficulties to implement a political solution and calls on the international community, the UN, OUA and European Union to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* create the optimal conditions for the realisation of a fair, democratic and transparent referendum on self-determination;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* to support every initiative to create conditions for the direct dialogue between the two parties of the conflict, Morocco and the Polisario Front;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* to spare no effort ensuring the full implementation of the UN-OUA Peace Plan; denounces the situation of isolation of the occupied territories;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit in Switzerland of the Sahrawi MINURSO coordinator intended to present to the government a demand for good offices for a mediation and the search of a place for further negociations with Morocco.The Swiss authorities declared to be willing to study this demand. In occasion of different declarations Bachir Mustafa Sayed precised the conditions of the last September meetings with Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He considers on the Moroccan side a real will of dialog does exist, which is confirmed by the involvment of the Crown Prince. The dialog should continue on the base of written proposals - a totally new approach. The Sahrawis keep some hope despite Morocco tries to extend indefinitely the cease-fire, attempts to neutralize the international pressures it is undergoing, and tries to put the Polisario Front to sleep, while making great diplomatic efforts to lessen the international recognition of SADR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a new appointment for talks but it did not happen for lack of a mediator and a neutral place. The Sahrawi responsible declared that in a short-term the UN have to revive. Its new Secretary-General is willing to move forward. At the meeting mid-February with Mr. Kofi Annan, the Sahrawis will ask for the reinforcement of the MINURSO, which has to be removed of the Moroccan influence. The UN are involved by the Peace Plan, he added, and remain responsible of the matter. The Sahrawis are asking for supports in order to continue the negociations under fair conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - As fighting continues in eastern Zaire, ministers from six African states and the OAU are holding talks in Pretoria, South Africa, to prepare for a summit on the Great Lakes crisis. The talks - which began on Monday - follow a summit in Nairobi on December 16 1996 where Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Cameroon were mandated to spearhead peace efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's Foreign Minister Stephen Musyoka chaired the meeting; others attending were South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, Zimbabwe's Stanley Mudenge, Cameroon's Deputy Foreign Minister Francis Nkwain, Tanzania's Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, Congo's Destin Tatsa-Mboungou, and the Organisation of African Unity's assistant secretary general, Daniel Antonio.  Reuters report that South African foreign ministry officials hope to set up a summit of the presidents of the so-called &quot;peace quartet&quot;, which are those of South Africa, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Cameroon. The four presidents hope to enter into dialogue with leaders in Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The &quot;massive counter-offensive&quot; threatened by the Zairean army appears to be severely hampered by the logistics of re-supply, report AFP. AFP say local sources link the slow-down of the government's counter-offensive to problems of resupplying troops with weapons and ammunition by air, as no ground corridor has been established. Observers also point to controversy regarding soldiers' salaries, as the end of the month approaches. Demoralised Zairean soldiers, who earn an average of one dollar a month, have not been paid in months and have already staged two rebellions in Kinshasa. Fourteen soldiers were sentenced to death in Kinshasa for cowardice last week (January 21).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rwandan Defence Minister and Vice-President Paul Kagame remarked today that while he was taking threats regarding the Zairean counter-offensive seriously, the Zairean government seemed to be &quot;more talk than action&quot;.  Kagame told journalists at Kigali airport that the ADFL rebels appeared to be winning. He was seeing off Benjamin Mkapa, President of Tanzania, following two days of talks on the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Belgian Christian Taverniers, leader of the 280 white mercenaries reportedly spearheading Kinshasa's counter-offensive, has been quoted as calling for Kigali and Kinshasa to &quot;reach a political solution before the hostilities really start&quot;. The Belgian daily Le Soir printed an interview with Taverniers on Monday, in which he suggested former Belgian Prime Minister Leo Tindemans as mediator. Taverniers claimed the white mercenaries were funded by Kuwait and consisted of &quot;specialists&quot; in bush and counter- guerrilla warfare; he said the force included Serbs and Croats but claimed there was no European power involved and that there were no Angolans or South Africans &quot;in the game&quot;. The interview took an aggressive stance towards Rwanda, with Taverniers warning Rwandan Defence Minister Paul Kagame that Rwanda would not be attacked &quot;if he withdraws his troops from Zaire&quot;.  Taverniers was quoted by Le Soir as saying &quot;even if there are Zaireans in the opposing forces, I consider that Rwanda and even Uganda are leading the dance&quot; . Christian Taverniers is reported to be a friend of one of Africa's most notorious mercenaries, Bob Denard, who twice briefly took over the leadership of Comoros Island in the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* US-based Refugees International says that continued fighting in eastern Zaire prohibits mass repatriation of remaining refugees and complicates the delivery of even the most basic assistance. According to a bulletin issued by Refugees International yesterday (Monday January 27) there are at least 200, 000 refugees from Rwanda in Lubutu and Shabunda, eastern Zaire, &quot;clinging tenuously to life&quot;, as well as unknown numbers of Zairean displaced persons.  RI say those affected have been cut off from regular relief supplies of food and water and that declining health has led to deaths among the most vulnerable. Recommendations made by an RI assessment team include: immediate efforts by UN Special Representative for the Great Lakes Mohammed Sahnoun to negotiate a cease-fire; to avoid creation of permanent camps but supply minimum temporary assistance through an ad hoc structure created by relief agencies; expand access for relief fights; increase emergency assistance and equipment. RI documents the considerable obstacles in getting supplies into eastern Zaire, describing the poor condition of airstrips, the laborious transportation of sacks by bicycle and canoe, and the need for refugees to carry the sacks on their backs where vehicles fail to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A statement issued by UNHCR (24 January) stresses the problems of delivering aid to more than 200,000 refugees in Shabunda, Tingi-Tingi and Amisi. High Commissioner Sadako Ogata says that despite &quot;best efforts&quot; it is impossible to meet &quot;even the life saving needs of the most vulnerable refugees&quot;. UNHCR says many refugees, especially children, have already died from malnutrition and disease. The statement underlines the fact that many refugees &quot;remain under the control of the former Rwandan leadership, elements of which are armed&quot;. UNHCR states that seperation of refugees from armed elements &quot;is even more difficult now than in the previous camps&quot;. The statement says that many of the refugees have indicated to UNHCR that they wish to repatriate to Rwanda, but are trapped by the conflict zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the view of an unclassified cable from the US embassy in Rwanda, dated 21 January 1997, agencies should pull out (from Tingi-Tingi) and &quot;stop feeding the killers, who will then run away to look for other sustenance leaving their hostages behind.&quot; The dispatch concludes &quot;If we do not, we will be trading the children in Tingi-Tingi against the children who will be killed and orphaned in Rwanda&quot;. Having faced widespread accusation that aid to refugee camps between 1994-1996 in eastern Zaire was fundamental to sustaining armed groups and preventing repatriation, humanitarian organisations and donors feel sensitive about appearing to re-create similar situtions. Moreover, since the crisis of repatriation from eastern Zaire last year, the Rwandan government has stressed the need for available resources to go to re-integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF records deaths in Tingi-Tingi as a total of 27 on January 21 and a total of 21 on January 22. Out of these 48 deaths, 21 were under the age of five. 250 severely malnourished children are being fed in the therapeutic centre in Tingi-Tingi, and 2,300 children are receiving supplementary feeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundian politicians opened a debate today to discuss the country's three year civil war; the debate was declared &quot;national&quot; but major parties, including all predominantly Hutu groups, boycotted the session. Rebels from the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) were not invited to the talks, and have been told to first renounce violence. Burundian leader, Pierre Buyoya, opened the four-day meeting in Bujumbura, which is intended to be the first step in a national debate lasting until March. Buyoya has been told he must talk to rebels before regional sanctions are lifted - which he has not complied with, but not ruled out. Buyoya said that regional sanctions were &quot;killing' chances for peace rather than encouraging it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman for CNDD, Jerome Ndiho, claimed in a statement sent to Nairobi today from Brussels that CNDD's armed wing had killed 61 army troops in the past nine days, reports AFP. Ndiho dismissed claims by the government that its forces had seized large numbers of rebel weapons in an offensive in Kibira forest, northwest Burundi, a known rebel hideout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A UNICEF-led inter-agency assessment mission visited northeast Kenya last week to investigate the current drought situation and its effects on the population, assess current relief assistance efforts and determine the scope of a future UN response. The mission, which visited Garissa, Isiolo, Wajir and Mandera districts, included the UN Resident Coordinator and representatives of the Office of the President, USAID, WFP and UNDHA/IRIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of successive rains in the northeast has inhibited the regeneration of vegetation and led to water shortages for both humans and livestock. Water is scarce in the aridland of the northeast, and pans and dams are swiftly drying up, while boreholes are coming under pressure because of overuse and the inability of communities to afford diesel and spare parts.  The lack of vegetation and water has lead to worsening livestock health and a dramatic fall in livestock prices, eroding the purchasing power of pastoralist communities. Malnutrition is on the increase and there are growing concerns over the health of vulnerable groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission recommended an escalated relief programme to address the drought situation, including interventions in the food, water, health and livestock sectors. The team have also set forth recommendations to the Government of Kenya, including the lifting of the import tax on maize, road improvements before the onset of the next rainy season, and measures to subsidize communities' efforts to pay for the costs of food transport, health care and education during the crisis period. A full mission report will be made available to the donor community in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no hospitalized case either in Booue or Libreville. The last case died on 8 January 1997. Libreville: 14 cases, including 10 deaths. Forty- eight contacts within the city are still being followed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The geographic distribution of the contacts were the areas of Okala, Owendo, Nzeng-Ayong, Gros Bouquet, Plaine Orety, Casepga and Melen hospital (5 healthy contacts, including 3 children admitted for closer follow up). Booue area, including Makokou: 44 cases, including 33 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently 54 contacts are being followed up in Makokou, Booue, Lolo I, Lolo II, Djidji, SHM sawmill, Lassio, Ndjole and Matora. Lambarene: 1 case who died. Four contacts are currently being followed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All contact subjects under follow-up are visited daily for temperature checks. Three quarters of them will be discharged from follow-up early next week as their follow-up period will have reached the maximum incubation period (i.e. 21 days).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Ghanaian cedi continued its &quot;creeping depreciation&quot; this week, opening Monday at the average exchange rate of 1,753 to one U.S. dollar from an average of 1,746 to the greenback last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealers attribute the continued depreciation of the cedi to the scarcity of hard currency for the settlement of the country's huge import bills.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, who made the announcement Monday, said that Cameroon and Nigeria had accepted Guinea's offer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eckhard said that the Guinean foreign minister, Lamine Kamara, was in New York to consult with the U.N. assistant secretary-general for political affairs, Lansana Kouyate, over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamara is also expected to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to discuss ways of resolving the dispute, which has flared up repeatedly since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo has also been involved in past mediation efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, during a visit of to Cameroon and Nigeria and to the disputed peninsula by a U.N. goodwill mission, the belligerents proposed measures aimed at improving relations between them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ruling on the ownership of the peninsula, thought to be rich in petroleum and fish, is pending at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, where it was referred for arbitration by Cameroon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Regional trade among the 12 states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has increased by almost 12.  5 percent since South Africa and Mauritius joined the organization, a reports by the community released recently says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report released in Gaborone, and published by the South African media, says that peace in Southern Africa and the introduction of trade liberalization measures have led to the notable increase in intra-regional trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, which is to be submitted next week to the SADC consultative conference in Windhoek, says the regional countries of Southern Africa are trading favorably in agricultural products, mining, food products, textiles, clothing, beverages, wood products and industrial chemicals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identified obstacles to trade in the region are an inadequate production base, inadequate trade policies and market access, insufficient market skill, underdeveloped financial infrastructure, and inadequate trade statistics and information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another report to be submitted to the conference, and concentrating on trade and industry, says that low savings have hampered the level of investment in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Average regional saving capacity is below 20 percent, the report says, because most SADC countries are underdeveloped and suffer negative real interest rates, high investment risks and low returns, scarce finance and an absence of secondary markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that intra-regional investment was being further restricted by complicated exchange control regulations often unfamiliar in the commercial banking sector. It says the cross-border flow of labor in the SADC region is still legally restricted and in some countries there are considerable delays in the issue of work permits to foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a need for the SADC states to improve their tax regimes considerably, the report adds, as they are cumbersome and generally lack transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The states that make up SADC are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - South African and Mozambican policemen have recovered at least 100 cars in the central Beira and 50 others in Chimoio, suspected to have been stolen from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A usually informed Maputo publication, Mediafax, reported Tuesday that the cars were seized in joint patrols which began at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mediafax, published by a cooperative of Mozambican journalists, quoted sources in the port city of Beira as saying that about 20 South African policemen were involved in the exercise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the South African Embassy, nor the general command of the Mozambican Police, were prepared to give details about the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the unnamed Beira sources told the newspaper that the South Africans began working over the weekend in groups of two, each accompanied by one armed Mozambican policeman and two unarmed traffic police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint police units stop any car which they suspect and check the engine number. They then radio a mobile communications unit to check whether or not the car is stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the engine number is on the list of stolen vehicles, the car is immediately seized and taken to parking lots set up for this operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some drivers of stolen vehicles have been detained, although some have protested that they purchased the cars in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have also entered private garages without search warrants and are using master keys to open parked vehicles in the absence of their owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at the South African Embassy in Maputo would say nothing other than that the operation is being undertaken simultaneously in four Southern African Development Community (SADC) states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to maintain secrecy if the operation is to be a success,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general commander of the Mozambican Police, Pascoal Ronda, declined immediate comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African policemen have, recently, also operated in neighbouring Zambia in an effort to stem the rising wave of drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bilateral relationship between Russia and Nigeria on (the) Ajaokuta project has indeed grown from strength to strength over the years from the design stage to its present state,&quot; said Ine Dappa, the ministry's spokesperson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was in reaction to a recent report by a section of the Nigerian media, quoting officials of the ministry, to the effect that the project contract had been terminated over unpaid bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dappa said a meeting of the ministry's officials and TPE &quot;is scheduled to hold in Nigeria shortly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Nigeria had settled &quot;a substantial part of its debt on the project, &quot; which is believed to have reached 98 percent completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operational hitches had delayed the 1983 completion of the gigantic steel project, conceived in the 1960s to launch Nigeria into industrial age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, several units of the project, located in central Nigeria, have been completed. They are producing rods and other steel and foundry products.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian sports authorities have appointed Monday Sinclair as the new local Chief national soccer coach, replacing the sacked Shuaibu Amodu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the changes on Monday, Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo said Sinclair, a Nigerian, who has handled several of the country's professional clubs, was taking over from the sacked Shuaibu Amodu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amodu lost his job on Monday because of his interviews to the media in which he complained about the pampering of foreign coaches by FA officials, who failed to provide the same financial resources local coaches assigned to handle national teams.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nwobodo insisted that a foreign technical adviser would be hired within three weeks to prepare the national team for crucial World Cup qualification matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of Amodu's former assistants were also fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sinclair, who was previously manager of Sharks of Port Harcourt, is to be assisted by James Peters, former coach of Nigeria's junior team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunde Disu, former head of the FA's technical crew, returns as chief coach of the junior team, the Flying Eagles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nwobodo said the association retained Paul Hamilton and Fanny Amu as coaches for the under-21 and under-17 squads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also named former Nigerian internationals Emmanuel Okala, Best Ogedegbe and Muzambilu Aliyu as goalkeeper trainers for the three national teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nwobodo also named Donatus Ohagwu as deputy to Sani Toro, the secretary- general of the Nigerian Football Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes came in the wake of poor performances by the national teams, which deflated the country's soccer pride, gained from the country's Olympic gold victory in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer analysts in Lagos attributed Amodu's sacking to his war of words with soccer administrators over the plan to hire of a foreign technical adviser to replace Johannes Bonfrere of the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutchman abruptly ended his contract with Nigeria shortly after leading the country's under-23 squad to win the Olympic soccer gold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian authorities set up a task force Tuesday to help end a crippling fuel scarcity in Lagos, the nation's commercial capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is headed by Maj. Gen. Timothy Shepidi, the chief of training and operations in the Defence Headquarters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting director of defence information, Col. Godwin Ugbo, told reporters in Lagos that members of the force had met with the petroleum resources minister, Dan Etete, and officials of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugvo said the week-long shortage, limited to Lagos, could ease within days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lagos military administrator, Col. Mohammed Marwa, met with Etete Monday and expressed concern that the fuel shortage could undermine security in this city of some six million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortage has paralysed business, leaving motorists and commuters groaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, an oil-producing country, experiences occasional fuel scarcity.  These have been blamed partly on hoarding, smuggling and distribution or maintenance difficulties. At times, the country has had to import petrol to bridge the shortfall in local supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current shortage is attributed to a payment disagreement between the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, and between the corporation and oil marketers.</SPAN></P>
